This method is an observation based projection similar than the classic Moore\u0027s Law in miroelectronics. The Moore\u0027s law is not based on any physics law and yet has anticipated the development of microelectronics for decades. This work is an empirical relation to decribe the evolution of epidemic to pandemic situations in different countries. The country was selected as an observation unit because the regulation and political decision is an national decision for numerous measures such as the implementation of social distancing, the quarantine of suspected cases, and the closing of borders to achieve territorial containment.",
