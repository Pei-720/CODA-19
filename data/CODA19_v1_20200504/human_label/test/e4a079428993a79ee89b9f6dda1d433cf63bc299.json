      "original_text": "A pproximately 14.2 million red cell units and 1.6 million platelet transfusions (\u003e80% single donor apheresis platelet units and the rest pools of usually six random donor platelet units) are administered in the United States each year [1,2,3]. Transfusion-related adverse events can occur with 10% of transfusions, and serious adverse events have been estimated to less than 0.5% of transfusions. Early estimates indicated that transfusion-associated adverse events could lead to a short-term (ie, not including disease transmission-related deaths) mortality of 1 to 1.2 deaths per 100,000 patients, or approximately 35 transfusion-related deaths/year in the United States [1,2]. More recent estimates suggest transfusion-related deaths are under-reported, and that long-term or total (ie, including disease transmission-related deaths) mortality is probably closer to one death per every 37,000 platelet or 130,000 red cell units administered, or approximately 220 transfusion-related deaths per year in the United States [1]. Even these estimates, however, may be underestimating transfusion-related mortality. For example, there were only 21 transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)-related fatalities reported in 2003 [4], while projections based on an incidence of 1:5,000 transfusions with a 6% mortality rate indicate that this syndrome can account for at least 300 deaths annually in the United States. With respect to the leading causes of death, reports to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from 2001 to 2003 indicated that TRALI (16% to 22%), ABO Blood Group hemolytic transfusion reactions (12% to 15%), and bacterial contamination of platelets (11% to 18%) accounted for 40% to 50% of all transfusion-related deaths [5] .",
