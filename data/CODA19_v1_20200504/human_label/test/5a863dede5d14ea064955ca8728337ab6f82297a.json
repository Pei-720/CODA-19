Concurrently, a number of viral inhibitors of innate immune signalling have been instrumental tools in the discovery of key host pathways. Here we discuss how viral inhibitors of the apoptotic and innate signalling pathways have further enhanced the understanding of both research fields and are beginning to shed light on how these two pathways converge.",
