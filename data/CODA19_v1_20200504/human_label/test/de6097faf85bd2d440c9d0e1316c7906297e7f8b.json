      "original_text": "RNA-based approaches have provided novel alternatives for modern drug discovery. The application of RNA as therapeutic agents has, until recently, been hampered by issues related to poor delivery and stability, but chemical modifications and new delivery approaches have increased progress. Moreover, the discovery of the importance of RNA in gene regulation and gene silencing has revealed new drug targets, especially related to treatment of cancer and other diseases. Recent engineering of small molecules designed from RNA sequences to target miRNAs opens up new possibilities in drug development. Furthermore, RNA-based vaccines have been engineered applying RNA virus vectors and non-viral delivery for vaccine development.",
