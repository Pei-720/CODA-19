      "original_text": "Using feminist political economy, this article argues that companions hired privately by families to care for residents in publicly funded long-term care facilities (nursing homes) are a liminal and invisible labour force. A care gap, created by public sector austerity, has resulted in insufficient staff to meet residents\u0027 health and social care needs. Families pay to fill this care gap in public funding with companion care, which limits demands on the state to collectively bear the costs of care for older adults. We assess companions\u0027 work in light of Vosko\u0027s (2015) and Rodgers and Rodgers\u0027 (1989) dimensions for precariousness. We discuss how to classify paid care work that overlaps with paid formal and unpaid informal care. Our findings illuminate how companions\u0027 labour is simultaneously autonomous and precarious; it fills a care gap and creates one, and can be relational compared with staffs\u0027 task-oriented work.",
