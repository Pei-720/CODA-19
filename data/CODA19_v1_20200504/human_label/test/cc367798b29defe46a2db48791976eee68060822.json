Modern states incorporate elaborate public health bureaucracies tasked with either containing or eliminating pathogen outbreaks. States are thus highly cognitive entities at the institutional level. It is then appropriate, indeed arguably necessary, to reconsider vector-borne infection from a control theory perspective.",
