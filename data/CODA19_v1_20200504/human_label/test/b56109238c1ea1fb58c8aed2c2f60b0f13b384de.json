They have potential health benefits and substantiate evidence for their nutraceutical applications. Diarylheptanoids are part of the broad class of plant phenolics with structurally divergent compounds. They have been used in traditional medicines and homemade remedies to treat various ailments, as organoleptic additives in foods, and also for aesthetic purposes. With their potential therapeutic and organoleptic characteristics, diarylhepatanoids can be rightly termed as nutraceuticals. This review summarizes the wide range of pharmacological activities of diarylhepatanoids and nutraceutical formulations, with relevance to human health.",
