      "original_text": "In adults, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality during the acute phase. 1 Worldwide case fatality rate has been reported to be 11% and ranged from 7% to 27% for the most severely affected regions. 2 The course of SARS in adults has been described as triphasic. 3 Patients are relatively stable within the first week, which is the active viral replication phase. In the second week about 80% of the patients will develop progressive pneumonic changes with increasing oxygen requirement (\u0027immune response phase\u0027). About 25% will develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. The clinical course in young children is markedly different; they appear to develop a milder form of the disease than adolescents or adults. Two distinct patterns of clinical presentation are noted; 4 teenagers present with symptoms of malaise, myalgia, chills and rigor similar to those of adults, whereas younger children present with cough and runny nose and none had chills, rigor or myalgia. In the recent epidemic, no children of less than 12 years of age required ICU admission and most never developed an oxygen requirement. In contrast, some adolescents may have a more progressive course, though less aggressive than that seen in adult patients. It is also important to note that no fatalities among the paediatric age group were reported.",
