These emitted microorganisms may associate with dust, and are suspected to pose a risk of airborne infection to humans in vicinity and to animals on other farms. However, the extent to which airborne transmission may play a role in the epidemic, and how dust acts as a carrier of microorganisms in the transmission processes is unknown. The authors present the current knowledge of the entire process of airborne transmission of microorganisms-from suspension and transportation until deposition and infection-and their relation to dust. The sampling and the mitigation techniques of airborne microorganisms and dust in livestock production systems are introduced as well.",
