The BAMG regenerates exhibited contractile activity to electrical field stimulation and a qualitatively identical pattern of response to muscarinic, purinergic, a-and p-adrenergic drug administration and nitric oxide. At 4 months after surgery, the maximum forces of contraction of the BAMG regenerates to carbachol stimulation amounted to close to 80% of the host bladder response. With electrical field stimulation, they equaled 44% and 62% of the host bladder response after 2.5 and 4 months, respectively. Histological and immunohistochemical studies confirmed the presence of receptors for neurotransmitters that these functional in vitro studies implied.",
