      "original_text": "Porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is one of the major etiological agents of viral enteritis and fetal diarrhea in suckling piglets. In this study, a TGEV JS2012 strain was isolated from the feces of piglets in Jiangsu Province, China. The phylogenetic analysis showed that TGEV JS2012 was placed between the Purdue and the Miller clusters. Analysis of recombination confirmed that TGEV JS2012 is a natural recombinant strain between Miller M6 and Purdue 115. Similar to Miller M6, virulent Purdue and China strain TS, in S gene the JS2012 maintained genetic integrity and the characteristics of the TGEV virulent strains. In vivo, TGEV JS2012 caused 100% mortality in newborn piglets, indicating the strong pathogenicity of this isolate. These results reveal that the JS2012 is a novel natural recombinant TGEV with high virulence. Our findings provide valuable information about genetic diversity and infection mechanism of the coronavirus family.",
