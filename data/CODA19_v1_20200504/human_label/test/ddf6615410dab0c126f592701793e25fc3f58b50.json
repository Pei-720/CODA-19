      "original_text": "cis-Autoproteolysis is a post-translational modification necessary for the function of ThnT, an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the β-lactam antibiotic thienamycin. This modification generates an N-terminal threonine nucleophile that is used to hydrolyze the pantetheinyl moiety of its natural substrate. We determined the crystal structure of autoactivated ThnT to 1.8 Å through X-ray crystallography. Comparison to a mutationally inactivated precursor structure revealed several large conformational rearrangements near the active site. To probe the relevance of these transitions, we designed a pantetheine-like chloromethyl ketone (CMK) inactivator and cocrystallized it with ThnT. Although this class of inhibitor has been in use for several decades, the mode of inactivation had not been determined for an enzyme that uses an N-terminal nucleophile. The co-crystal structure revealed the CMK bound to the N-terminal nucleophile of ThnT through an ether linkage and analysis suggests inactivation through a direct displacement mechanism. More importantly, this inactivated complex shows three regions of ThnT that are critical to the formation of the substrate binding pocket undergo rearrangement upon autoproteolysis.",
