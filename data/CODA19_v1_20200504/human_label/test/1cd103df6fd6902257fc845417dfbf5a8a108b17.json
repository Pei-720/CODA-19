The detection rate for diarrheal viruses was 4.2 %. Adenovirus and enterovirus were equally detected as the most predominant viruses, with prevalence of 1.2 %, followed by Aichi virus (0.9 %) and norovirus GII (0.6 %). Mixed infection with norovirus GII and human parechovirus was also detected (0.3 %). This study provides epidemiological data for a wide variety of diarrheal viruses circulating in adult patients with diarrhea in Chiang Mai, Thailand.",
