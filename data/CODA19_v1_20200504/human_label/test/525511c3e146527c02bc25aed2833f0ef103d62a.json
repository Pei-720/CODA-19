Compared to the TT or TG genotypes, the GG genotype was associated with severe dyspnoea (modified medical research council score ≥ median 3; 22 vs 42%, p \u003d 0.030). The CC genotype of the rs12979860 SNP was associated with a poorer prognosis (body mass index, airflow obstruction, dyspnea and exercise capacity index ≥ median 4; 46 vs. 36% TC vs. 20.5% TT; p \u003d 0.031). Patients with stable COPD and at exacerbation had significantly lower circulating IFNL3 compared to healthy controls (p \u003c 0.001 and p \u003c 0. 001, respectively). Circulating IFNL3 correlated to post-bronchodilator FEV 1 %predicted and the tissue maturation biomarker Pro-collagen 3. Conclusion: IFNL3/4 polymorphisms and circulating IFNL3 may be associated with disease activity and outcomes in COPD.
