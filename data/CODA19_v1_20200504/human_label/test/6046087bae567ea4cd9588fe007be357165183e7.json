This approach relies on the three unique elements: (i) detection probes that regulate DNA polymerase activity in response to the complementary target DNA; (ii) universal reporters conjugated with a single fluorophore; and (iii) fluorescence polarization (FP) detection. As a proof-of-concept, the assay was used to detect and sub-type Salmonella bacteria with sensitivities down to a single bacterium in relatively short periods of time.",
