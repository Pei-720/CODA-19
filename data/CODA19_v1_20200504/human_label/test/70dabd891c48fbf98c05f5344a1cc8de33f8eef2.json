These developments will also force Taiwan to respond by taking more active actions for the sole purpose of safeguarding its sovereignty and maritime jurisdiction in the SCS. This article discusses a number of possible confidence-building measures that could be considered for adoption by China to help engage Taiwan in the regional security dialogue process and enable Taiwan to participate in the planned joint co-operative activities in the SCS. The co-operative actions taken in the SCS area could enhance mutual trust between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. r",
