      "original_text": "Viral proteins of two strains of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which have different tissue trophism and serology, were separated on the basis of their isoelectric points (pl). The viruses have four structural proteins; the protein of greatest serological importance is found at the peplomer tip. The viral structural proteins separated by isoelectric focusing were identified by comparison to SDS-PAGE separations. Three protein bands were identical in pl and one protein band showed a difference in pZ between strains. When the renatured viral proteins were Western blotted and reacted with strain-specific antiserum, antigen-antibody complexing was seen only at points corresponding to the strain-specific variant bands. For IBV strain Mass-41, antigenantibody complexing occurred at a pl of 6.8, and, for IBV strain Ark-99, at 7.2. No cross reaction of antisera was observed for either strain.",
