We divide the population into subgroups in which the periods of disease protection are the same for all persons in a subgroup. For example, consider a subgroup in which antibiotic protection begins at time t 1 and stops at time t 2 , then we set t 3 to infinity in equation (1). Suppose further that post-exposure vaccine protection is achieved at t v , which occurs before antibiotic protection stops (t v , t 2 ), then t 2 and t 3 are set to infinity. If vaccine protection occurs after antibiotic protection stops then t 3 is set equal to t v . The cumulative probability of disease in the population (c) is then a weighted average of the values of c for each subgroup, where the weights are the proportions of people in subgroups. These proportions are determined by the distributions of times in which vaccine immunity is achieved, and the antibiotic start and stop dates (determined by antibiotic adherence rates and efficacy). Among persons exposed to the ID(P), the percentage of cases prevented with post-exposure interventions is:",
