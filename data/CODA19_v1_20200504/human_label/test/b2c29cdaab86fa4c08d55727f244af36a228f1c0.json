Up-converting phosphor technology-based point-of-care testing (UPT-POCT) can detect bioterrorism agents from various samples with high sensitivity and specificity, in particular it shows robust performance for complicated samples, such as food, powder, viscera and grains. The tolerance of UPT-POCT to sample is based on the physical and luminescence stability of UCNPs, the stable covalent interaction between UCNPs and antibody, as well as the strong buffering capacity of the detection system. Reliable results can be obtained in a short time period using a portable biosensor by nonprofessionals owing to the simple nature of UPT-POCT operation and sample pre-treatment.",
