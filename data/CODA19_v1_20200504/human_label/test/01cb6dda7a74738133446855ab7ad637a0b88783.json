Presumably, PRRSV infection enhances PCV2 replication as a result of modulation of host immunity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate PCV2 replication and pathogenesis in pigs vaccinated with a PRRS modified live virus (MLV) vaccine and subsequently challenged with a combination of PRRSV and PCV2. During the early postchallenge period, the number of pigs with PRRSV-associated clinical signs was decreased, and average daily gain (ADG) was increased, in the vaccinated group, demonstrating the protective effect of PRRS vaccination. However, during the later postchallenge period, more pigs in the vaccinated group showed increased PCV2 viremia, decreased ADG, increased PCVAD clinical signs, and increased mortality. In this disease model, the early benefits of PRRSV vaccination were outweighed by the later amplification of PCVAD.",

Vaccination with a porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) modified live virus vaccine followed by challenge with PRRS virus and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) protects against PRRS but enhances PCV2 replication and pathogenesis compared to results for nonvaccinated cochallenged controls. Biosafety Committees. The study was conducted as part of the evaluation of a previously described genomic marker, WUR (17). The population used in this study was composed of pigs with two genotypes: 50% had WUR genotype AA, and 50% had WUR genotype AB or BB. The AB and BB genotypes were predicted to have beneficial effects on the response to PRRSV infection. Both the vaccine group and the nonvaccine group were balanced according to WUR genotype; therefore, WUR was not a factor in the comparison of the outcomes of the vaccine and nonvaccine groups. Three-week-old barrows (n ϭ 226; average age, 19.4 Ϯ 1.8 days) were obtained from a high-health commercial source negative for PRRSV. While the pigs were derived from a sow herd previously vaccinated with a PCV2 capsid subunit vaccine, the piglets were not vaccinated for PCV2 and were obtained after weaning without regard to maternal antibody levels. All pigs were housed in two environmentally controlled rooms at the Kansas State University Large Animal Research Center and were maintained under biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) conditions. Rooms were chemically disinfected, cleaned with a high-heat pressure washer, and gas decontaminated with vaporized hydrogen peroxide prior to use. Both rooms were empty for at least 19 days prior to the start of the study. Pigs were housed in 20 pens, each with an area of 144 ft 2 , with 11 to 12 pigs per pen. Pigs were given access to food and water ad libitum.",

PRRSV (isolate KS62; GenBank accession no. KM035803) was isolated by propagation on MARC-145 cells. The PRRSV component of the challenge inoculum, KS62, shared 88.06% identity with the MLV (GenBank accession no. AF159149) at the peptide sequence level of GP5. Since wild-type PCV2b (GenBank accession no. JQ692110) does not propagate to high levels in cell culture, we took advantage of the heat stability of PCV2 to make a virus preparation from a lymph node suspension enriched for PCV2. The suspension was heat treated at 55°C for 30 min to remove PRRSV, bacteria, and other heat-labile agents. The treated homogenate was recombined with the isolated PRRSV in order to infect cesarean-derived, colostrumdeprived (CD/CD) pigs. A combination lung/lymph node homogenate was prepared from the CD/CD pigs, and PRRSV and PCV2 were isolated from the homogenate by the methods described above. Analysis of the heat-treated preparation for common agents showed that the preparation was negative for most heat-stable agents, such as parvovirus, but still positive for torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) and porcine oncovirus (PCOV), which are ubiquitous.",
