The ophthalmic examination is able to provide detailed inlife information and is used in combination with clinical observations, clinical pathology, and histopathology to assess potential toxicologic effects. The ophthalmologist must be familiar with the wide range of species used in the field of toxicology, be familiar with the anatomic variations associated with these species, be able to determine what is an inherited or a breed-related finding from a study-related effect, be competent with the required ophthalmic equipment, and be capable of examining this wide range of animals.",
