These astonishing outcomes obtained by scientists exploiting graphene in many fields, including sensor technology, resulted in the largest research initiative in the European Union (UE) with the \"Graphene Flagship\", tasked with taking graphene from laboratories into the market with a h1 billion budget [2]. If it is well established that nanomaterials entail inorganic materials, there is a new emerging vision, according to which biological materials as DNA and proteins can be considered as nanoscale entities being capable of folding in nanostructures [3À5]. As reported by Nature Nanotechnology journal \"the ability of DNA to selfassemble into a variety of nanostructures and nanomachines is highlighted in a growing number of papers in Nature Nanotechnology. The appeal of DNA to nanoscientists is threefold: first, it is a natural nanoscale material; second, a large number of techniques for studying DNA are already available; and third, its ability to carry information can be exploited in the self-assembly process. DNA is also increasingly being used to organize other nanomaterials, and the related field of RNA nanotechnology is beginning to emerge\" [6]. DNA is largely exploited as biological recognition elements (bioreceptors) in the design of biosensors, a branch of sensor technology. Beside DNA, enzymes are also used as biological recognition elements for catalytic detection as well as peptides and antibodies for affinity detection.",
