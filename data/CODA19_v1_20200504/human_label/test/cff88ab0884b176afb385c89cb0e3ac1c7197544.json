In this study, the crystallization and preliminary crystallographic analysis of HCoV-OC43 N-NTD (amino acids 58-195) with a molecular weight of 20 kDa are reported. HCoV-OC43 N-NTD was crystallized at 293 K using PEG 1500 as a precipitant and a 99.9% complete native data set was collected to 1.7 Å resolution at 100 K with an overall R merge of 5.0%. The crystals belonged to the hexagonal space group P6 5 , with unit-cell parameters a \u003d 81.57, c \u003d 42.87 Å . Solvent-content calculations suggest that there is likely to be one subunit of N-NTD in the asymmetric unit.",
