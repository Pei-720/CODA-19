Several isoxazolidines inhibited the replication of both thymidine kinase wild-type and deficient (TK + and TK − ) varicella-zoster virus strains at EC 50 in the 5.4-13.6 µM range, as well as human cytomegalovirus (EC 50 \u003d 8.9-12.5 µM).

Another analogue, i.e., 2-methyl-3-(substituted-benzalamino)-4(3H)-quinazolinone 3, was found to exhibit antiviral activity against tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) in vivo. Compound 3 showed curative effects of 54%, which was slightly higher than that of a reference drug, Ningnanmycin [21] . Very recently quinazolin-4(3H)-ones 4-6 were synthesized and evaluated for inhibitory action on the replication of influenza A virus (H 5 N 1 ), as well as to test toxicity on in vitro cell lines. In general, quinazolin-4(3H)-ones containing a chalcone skeleton 4, thiosemicarbazone 5, and hydrazide 6 showed moderate antiviral activity against H 5 N 1 (inhibition rate: 38%, 47%, 25%, respectively, for 4, 5, 6) compared to a reference drug, Zanamivir [22] . In addition, compounds 7 and 8 possessing a nitro group at C6 were reported as potent inhibitors of Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus (VEEV) (EC 50 \u003d 0.8 µM, CC 50 \u003d 50 µM) [23] . Quinazolinone (aS)-9 displayed high selectivity for PI4KIIIα and appeared to be potent inhibitors of hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication in vitro. Moreover, compound (aS)-9 exhibited higher potency for PI4KIIIα than its atropisomer aR (pIC 50 of 8.3 vs. 6.9) and an improved selectivity range (2.7-3.2 vs. 1.4-2.1) against the other lipid kinases [24] .
