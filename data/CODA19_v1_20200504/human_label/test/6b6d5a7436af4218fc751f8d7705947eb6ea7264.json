      "original_text": "Over the past two decades, several strategies have emerged to characterize N-glycans of glycoproteins and identify the glycosites that are recognized and used by the cellular glycosylation machinery. Several methods employ endoglycosidases, such as PNGase F and PNGase A, to release the glycans from the protein, followed by analysis of glycoforms using MS [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] or high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) 36,37 with or without prior derivatization 38 . The MS-based methods provide a composition for each molecular ion, which is annotated as a high-mannose or complex-type glycan consistent with biosynthetic principles. Furthermore, tandem mass spectra of derivatized N-glycans generated by both matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization n-glycans contribute to the folding, stability and functions of the proteins they decorate. they are produced by transfer of the glycan precursor to the sequon asn-X-thr/ser, followed by enzymatic trimming to a high-mannose-type core and sequential addition of monosaccharides to generate complex-type and hybrid glycans. this process, mediated by the concerted action of multiple enzymes, produces a mixture of related glycoforms at each glycosite, making analysis of glycosylation difficult. to address this analytical challenge, we developed a robust semiquantitative mass spectrometry (Ms)-based method that determines the degree of glycan occupancy at each glycosite and the proportion of n-glycans processed from high-mannose type to complex type. It is applicable to virtually any glycoprotein, and a complete analysis can be conducted with 30 µg of protein. Here, we provide a detailed description of the method that includes procedures for (i) proteolytic digestion of glycoprotein(s) with specific and nonspecific proteases; (ii) denaturation of proteases by heating; (iii) sequential treatment of the glycopeptide mixture with two endoglycosidases, endo H and pnGase F, to create unique mass signatures for the three glycosylation states; (iv) lc-Ms/Ms analysis; and (v) data analysis for identification and quantitation of peptides for the three glycosylation states. Full coverage of site-specific glycosylation of glycoproteins is achieved, with up to thousands of high-confidence spectra hits for each glycosite. the protocol can be performed by an experienced technician or student/postdoc with basic skills for proteomics experiments and takes ~7 d to complete. protocol nature protocols | VOL.13 NO.6 | 2018 | 1197 (MALDI) and electrospray ionization (ESI) MS have been widely used for characterization of detailed structural information of N-glycans expressed in different biological systems 30,34 . Freely available software tools such as GRITS Toolbox (http://www.gritstoolbox.org/) are able to automatically process, annotate, and archive glycomics data in a high-throughput manner. The HPLC methods rely on retention times of N-glycan standards for identification of the glycan species. With both methods, supporting experiments using glycosidase digestions and/or permethylation analysis can provide additional support for structure assignments. Such methods find wide utility in characterizing glycosylation of highly studied glycoproteins such as immunoglobulins (e.g., IgG), or detecting individual differences in N-glycans of serum glycoproteins 36, 37, 39 . Although these methods provide key information about the nature of the glycoforms present on a glycoprotein and their relative abundance, they do not reveal which glycosites are utilized or the extent to which each glycosite is occupied.",
