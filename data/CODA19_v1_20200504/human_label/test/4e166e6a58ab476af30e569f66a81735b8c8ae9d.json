Because laboratory tests for fecal specimens are time-consuming and expensive, their inclusion in routine patient management usually is limited in nonhospitalized patients to those with severe or protracted diarrhea and in patients whose stool is shown to contain fecal leukocytes. Young children, hospitalized patients, debilitated individuals, and immunocompromised hosts are at particular risk for severe diarrheal disease and can benefit from appropriate laboratory support. The presence of a community outbreak is grounds for performing directed laboratory testing for diagnostic and epidemiologic purposes.",
