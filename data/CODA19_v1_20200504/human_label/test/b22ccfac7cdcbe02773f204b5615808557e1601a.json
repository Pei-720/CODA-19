      "original_text": "The mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) spike glycoprotein is a major determinant of neurovirulence. We investigated how alterations in spike affect neurovirulence using two isogenic recombinant viruses differing exclusively in spike. S 4 R, containing the MHV-4 spike gene, is dramatically more neurovirulent than S A59 R, containing the MHV-A59 spike gene (J. J. Phillips, M. M. Chua, E. Lavi, and S. R. Weiss, 1999, J. Virol. 73, 7752-7760). We examined the contribution of differences in cellular tropism, viral spread, and the immune response to infection to the differential neurovirulence of S 4 R and S A59 R. MHV-4 spike-mediated neurovirulence was associated with extensive viral spread in the brain in both neurons and astrocytes. Infection of primary hippocampal neuron cultures demonstrated that S 4 R spread more rapidly than S A59 R and suggested that spread may occur between cells in close physical contact. In addition, S 4 R infection induced a massive influx of lymphocytes into the brain, a higher percentage of CD8 ϩ T cells, and a higher frequency of MHV-specific CD8 ϩ T cells relative S A59 R infection. Despite this robust and viral-specific immune response to S 4 R infection, infection of RAG1Ϫ/Ϫ mice suggested that immune-mediated pathology also contributes to the high neurovirulence of S 4 R.",
