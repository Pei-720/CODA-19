Cell viability was determined by CCK8 assay, and fibrotic markers were measured by Western blotting. Vehicle or remdesivir were given by intraperitoneal injection or renal injection through the left ureter in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) mice. Serum and kidneys were harvested. The concentrations of remdesivir and GS-441524 were measured using LC-MS/MS. Renal and liver function were assessed. Renal fibrosis was evaluated by Masson\u0027s trichrome staining and Western blotting. Results: Remdesivir and GS-441524 inhibited cell proliferation and the expression of fibrotic markers (fibronectin, pSmad3, and aSMA) in NRK-49F and HK2 cells.",
