      "original_text": "Background: Ebolaviruses induce lethal viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) in humans and non-human primates, with the exceptions of Reston virus (RESTV), which is not pathogenic for humans. In human VHF cases, extensive analyses of the humoral immune responses in survivors and non-survivors have shown that the IgG responses to nucleoprotein (NP) and other viral proteins are associated with asymptomatic and survival outcomes, and that the neutralizing antibody responses targeting ebolaviruses glycoprotein (GP 1,2 ) are the major indicator of protective immunity. On the other hand, the immune responses in non-human primates, especially naturally infected ones, have not yet been elucidated in detail, and the significance of the antibody responses against NP and GP 1,2 in RESTV-infected cynomolgus macaques is still unclear. In this study, we analyzed the humoral immune responses of cynomolgus macaque by using serum specimens obtained from the RESTV epizootic in 1996 in the Philippines to expand our knowledge on the immune responses in naturally RESTV-infected non-human primates. Results: The antibody responses were analyzed using IgG-ELISA, an indirect immunofluorescent antibody assay (IFA), and a pseudotyped VSV-based neutralizing (NT) assay. Antigen-capture (Ag)-ELISA was also performed to detect viral antigens in the serum specimens. We found that the anti-GP 1,2 responses, but not the anti-NP responses, closely were correlated with the neutralization responses, as well as the clearance of viremia in the sera of the RESTV-infected cynomolgus macaques. Additionally, by analyzing the cytokine/chemokine concentrations of these serum specimens, we found high concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines, such as IFNγ, IL8, IL-12, and MIP1α, in the convalescent phase sera.",
