      "original_text": "In tribute to Jules Dupuit, this study analyzes how the innovative financing tax for development has influenced the competition among airline companies and to what extent it affected their sales. To do so, we specify an econometric model where the representative consumer chooses the utility maximizing alternative among the differentiated products offered by the airlines which compete in terms of prices. It is a fairly reasonable and well accepted representation of the competition in the airline industry, assuming that the structure of their networks is given in the short run. The present solidarity tax has increased the average price for the European airlines by only 0:08% and could increase average prices by 1% if it were applied to all European airlines. Implemented by all countries it would lead to a 0:17% increase in Air France prices while the price increase would be 1:05% for the other airlines in our sample. These numbers compared to the growth rate of the air traffic show that the impact of the solidarity tax would be very small. Overall the air ticket levy applied by all European airlines would not affect significantly the degree of competition among airlines.",

A first key question is then how to estimate what he calls the \"strength of desire\" of consumers and he writes: \"it is beyond doubt that a tax can add nothing to the utility of a product; but when we look at it from the consumer\u0027s point of view we can say that its existence brings to light undeniably that the product has a utility greater than the cost of production.\" (See Dupuit, 1884, p. 85.) A buyer pays a good on which a tax is imposed if he finds at least an equivalent utility in it. Dupuit adds: \"for, in spite of the tax, he is at perfect liberty to buy it or not to buy it. It is not within the power of the state to make him pay, by means of the tax, anything more than the utility which he derives from this purchase.\" (See Dupuit, 1884, p. 85.) A second key question is to account for the differentiation of products which can trigger as many \"strength of desire\" than they are consumers. Jules Dupuit is one of the first economists to address this situation by business strategies based on price discrimination. In this sense, the market structure is really close to oligopolistic competition.",
