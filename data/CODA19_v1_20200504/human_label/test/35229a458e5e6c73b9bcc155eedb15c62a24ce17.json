Then, the questionnaire was completed by 290 staff members of Masih Daneshvari Hospital and its internal consistency and reproducibility were investigated using Cronbach\u0027s alpha coefficient and testretest method, respectively. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to assess its consistency and internal consistency (construct validity). Results: With the confirmation of the face and content validities, internal consistency (0.89) calculated by the Cronbach\u0027s alpha coefficient and reproducibility of the questionnaire (0.997; p\u003c0.001) assessed by using the ICC Index, were approved. Following examining internal consistency and stability, the questionnaire convergent construct validity was also confirmed using confirmatory factor analysis. Conclusion: The questionnaire contained 42 items and it is beneficial to use it in the health care system to evaluate the ergonomic problems of the respirators and to have optimal choice in this respect. Also, it can be used in the promotion of the staffs\u0027 behavior in wearing these respirators when necessary.",
