We report the crystal structure of the hexadecameric nsp7-nsp8 supercomplex from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus at 2.4-Å resolution. nsp8 has a novel \u0027golf-club\u0027 fold with two conformations. The supercomplex is a unique hollow, cylinder-like structure assembled from eight copies of nsp8 and held tightly together by eight copies of nsp7. With an internal diameter of B30 Å , the central channel has dimensions and positive electrostatic properties favorable for nucleic acid binding, implying that its role is to confer processivity on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.",
