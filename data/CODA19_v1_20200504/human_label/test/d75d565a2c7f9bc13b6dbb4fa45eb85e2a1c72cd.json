Their risk of experiencing outbreaks can be greater than in many high income countries, while their capacity to respond effectively may be constrained by competing demands on limited health care system resources. The globalised nature of health security argues for international support to improve local health care systems, but limited data makes risk assessment and decision making difficult. We propose a mathematical modelling framework that can help explore a variety of outbreak and intervention scenarios. Our framework can assist with the identification of constraints that limit the ability of local health care systems to detect and respond to EID outbreaks in a timely and effective fashion, and assess the relative importance of these constraints to help establish priorities for health care system support. We illustrate the use of our framework by considering the importation of Ebola into the Asia-Pacific region, with results emphasising the critical role played by effective surveillance in controlling localised outbreaks.
