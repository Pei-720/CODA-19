      "original_text": "A retrospective viral load study was performed on clinical specimens from 154 patients with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); the specimens were prospectively collected during patients\u0027 illness. Viral load in nasopharyngeal aspirates (n \u003d 142) from day 10 to day 15 after onset of symptoms was associated with oxygen desaturation, mechanical ventilation, diarrhea, hepatic dysfunction, and death. Serum viral load (n \u003d 53) was associated with oxygen desaturation, mechanical ventilation, and death. Stool viral load (n \u003d 94) was associated with diarrhea, and urine viral load (n \u003d 111) was associated with abnormal urinalysis results. Viral replications at different sites are important in the pathogenesis of clinical and laboratory abnormalities of SARS.",
