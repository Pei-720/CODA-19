Pathological studies of Japanese encephalitis have shown that the virus specifically infects neurons in the brain [3, 5] . However, this neurotropism has not been well characterized. Previously, we have shown that JEV specifically infects developing neurons in the suckling rat [12] . Interactions between host and virus influencing the outcome of infection are dynamic and complex. Usually, neural cell lines, such as neuroblastoma or glioma cell lines, have been used for studying the neurotropism of JEV [2] and other viruses [17] . The characteristics of original neural cells can, in general, be very different from those of cell lines, especially in the case of neurons. Recently it has been reported that primary brain culture are useful for studying the neurotropism of some viruses, for example, coronaviruses [13] and human immunodeficiency virus [10, 16] .
