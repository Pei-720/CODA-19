So far, studies of peptide and protein interactions with membranes have largely been limited to naturally occurring peptides or to sequences designed on the basis of structural information and biophysical parameters. To expand on these studies, utilizing a system with minimal assumptions, we used phage-display technology to identify 12 amino-acid-long peptides that bind to liposomes at pH 5.0 but not at pH 7.5. Of the nineteen peptides discovered three were able to cause leakage of liposome contents. Multivalent presentation of these membrane-active peptides by conjugation onto poly(L-Lysine) enhanced their lytic potential. Secondary structures were analyzed by circular dichroism in aqueous 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol and in buffered aqueous solutions, in both the presence and absence of liposomes. Two of the three lytic peptides show alpha helical profiles whereas none of the non-lytic peptides formed stable secondary structures.",
