      "original_text": "The study was aimed at assessing T cell subsets of peripheral blood from recipients of long-term functioning (more than 60 months) biological and mechanical heart valve prostheses. The absolute and relative number of CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets was analyzed: naïve (N, CD45RA + CD62L + ), central memory (CM, CD45RA − CD62L + ), effector memory (EM, CD45RA − CD62L − ), and terminally differentiated CD45RA-positive effector memory (TEMRA, CD45RA + CD62L − ) in 25 persons with biological and 7 with mechanical prosthesis compared with 48 apparently healthy volunteers. The relative and absolute number of central memory and naïve CD3 + CD8 + in patients with biological prosthesis was decreased ( \u003c 0.001). Meanwhile the number of CD45RA + CD62L − CD3 + CD8 + and CD3 + CD4 + was increased ( \u003c 0.001). Patients with mechanical prosthesis had increased absolute and relative number of CD45RA + CD62L − CD3 + CD8 + cells ( \u003d 0.006). Also the relative number of CD3 + CD4 + cells was reduced ( \u003d 0.04). We assume that altered composition of T cell subsets points at development of xenograft rejection reaction against both mechanical and biological heart valve prostheses.",
