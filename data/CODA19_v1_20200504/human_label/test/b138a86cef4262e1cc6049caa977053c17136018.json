The severity and duration of clinical infection in the Bx chicks resembled that previously observed in the highly susceptible line 151 chicks, however no increase in mortality was observed, in contrast to the high levels of mortality recorded in IBV-inoculated line 151 chicks. After secondary challenge the degree of damage to the ciliated epithelium of the trachea was greater in the Bx chicks than in the intact chicks.",
