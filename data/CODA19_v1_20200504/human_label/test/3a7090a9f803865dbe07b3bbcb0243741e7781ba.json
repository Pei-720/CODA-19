The multi-target strategy involving the use of hybrid drugs has shown promise. In line with this, new hybrids of quinoline with pyrimidine have been synthesized and evaluated for their antiplasmodial activity against both CQ S and CQ R strains of Plasmodium falciparum. These depicted activity in nanomolar range and were found to bind to heme as well as AT rich pUC18 DNA.",
