      "original_text": "Since the 1980s, with the rise and proliferation of genetic engineering techniques and technologies, national and international security concerns have grown regarding the misuse of biology by state and non-state actors [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Over this timeframe, and particularly within the past 20 years, the rise of new digital and mobile technologies in terms of sensors, geospatial technologies, advanced analytics, social media, and cell phones, have made the collection and analysis of a wide variety of information, to include different types of biological data, more readily accessible. These developments provide opportunities to think about biodefense preparedness in new and unique ways. Harnessing digital technologies more effectively to better identify and assess emerging biosecurity threats could lead to improved detection, response, and preparedness measures to eliminate or at least mitigate a bioweapons attack.",
