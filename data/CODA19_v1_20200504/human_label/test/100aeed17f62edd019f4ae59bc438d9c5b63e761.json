Blood samples were taken from all captured sheep until 1993 and stored in preservative at 220 8C. Sampling resumed in 1997, when hair samples were taken from all captured sheep by plucking 50-100 hairs including roots from the back or flank. Hairs were kept either in paper envelopes or plastic bags containing about 5 g of silica at room temperature. From 1998 to 2002, a tissue sample from each captured sheep was taken from the ear with an 8-mm punch. Ear tissue was kept at 220 8C in a solution of 20% dimethylsulphoxide saturated with NaCl. We sampled 433 marked individuals over the course of the study.",
