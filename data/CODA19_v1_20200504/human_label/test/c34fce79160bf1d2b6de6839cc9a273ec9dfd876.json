Ten principles set forth guidance on choice of ages, choice of stocks, the importance of specific pathogen-free status, the uses of necropsy data, the dangers of pooling samples from different individuals, planning ahead for loss of aged mice to death and disease, the use of cost-adjusted power calculations, and the dangers of inferring causal associations from correlated age effects.",
