Objectives: To characterize complete SARS-CoV S-gene sequences from Hong Kong. Study design: Fifty-six SARS-CoV S-gene sequences, obtained from patients who presented with SARS to the Prince of Wales Hospital during March-May 2003, were analysed using a maximum likelihood (ML) approach, together with 138 other (both human and animal) S-gene sequences downloaded from GenBank. Results: The maximum-likelihood (ML) trees showed little evolution occurring within these 56 sequences. Analysis with the other sequences, showed three distinct SARS clusters, closely correlated to previously defined early, middle and late phases of the 2003 international SARS outbreaks. In addition, two new single nucleotide variations (SNVs), T21615A and T21901A, were discovered, not previously reported elsewhere.",
