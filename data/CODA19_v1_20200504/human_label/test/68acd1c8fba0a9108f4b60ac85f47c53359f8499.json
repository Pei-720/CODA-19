DQP-1105 inhibited GluN2C-and GluN2D-containing receptors with IC 50 values that were at least 50-fold lower than those for recombinant GluN2A-, GluN2B-, GluA1-, or GluK2containing receptors. Inhibition was voltage-independent and could not be surmounted by increasing concentrations of either coagonist, glutamate or glycine, consistent with a noncompetitive mechanism of action. DQP-1105 inhibited single-channel currents in excised outside-out patches without significantly changing mean open time or single-channel conductance, suggesting that DQP inhibits a pregating step without changing the stability of the open pore conformation and thus channel closing rate. Evaluation of DQP-1105 inhibition of chimeric NMDA receptors identified two key residues in the lower lobe of the GluN2 agonist binding domain that control the selectivity of DQP-1105. These data suggest a mechanism for this new class of inhibitors and demonstrate that ligands can access, in a subunit-selective manner, a new site located in the lower, membrane-proximal portion of the agonist-binding domain.",
