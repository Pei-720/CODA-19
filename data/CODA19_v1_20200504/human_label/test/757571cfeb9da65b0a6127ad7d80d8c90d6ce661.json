Here we focus on the surface glycoprotein GP 1,2 and its different roles in filovirus entry. We first describe the latest advances on the characterization of GP geneoverlapping proteins sGP, ssGP and D-peptide. Then, we compare filovirus surface GP 1,2 proteins in terms of structure, synthesis and function. As they bear potential in drug-design, the discovery of small organic compounds inhibiting filovirus entry is a currently very active field. Although it is at an early stage, the development of antiviral drugs against Ebola and Marburg virus entry might prove essential to reduce outbreak-associated fatality rates through post-exposure treatment of both suspected and confirmed cases.",
