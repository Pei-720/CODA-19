Mice received the affinity-purified protein with either a saponin (QS21) or a Ribi (MPL + TDM) adjuvant subcutaneously and were challenged intranasally with SARS-CoV. Both regimens induced binding and neutralizing antibodies and protection against SARS-CoV intranasal infection. However, the best results were obtained with QS21 and protein, which provided the highest antibody as well as complete protection of the upper and lower respiratory tract.
