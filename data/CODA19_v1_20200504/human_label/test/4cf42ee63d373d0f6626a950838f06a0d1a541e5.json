However, its clinical role and pathogenicity has not been known. Objectives: To confirm that WU polyomavirus has been found in Chinese children. Study design: WU polyomavirus was detected and identified using PCR methods. A total of 278 specimens of nasopharyngeal aspirate were collected, and then PCR products were sequenced directly. Results: One of 278 nasopharyngeal aspirates was positive for WUPyV in one child, and the positive rate was 0.4%. The results showed that the sequences of genome, LTAg and VP2 gene was identical to the reference sequences of WU polyomavirus prototype strains. Conclusions: We confirmed that WU polyomavirus had been found and identified in the respiratory secretions in China.",
