      "original_text": "SARS coronavirus main protease (M pro ) plays an essential role in the extensive proteolytic processing of the viral polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab), and it is an important target for anti-SARS drug development. We have reported that both the M pro C-terminal domain alone (M pro -C) and the N-finger deletion mutant of M pro (M pro -D7) exist as a stable dimer and a stable monomer (Zhong et al., J Virol 2008; 82:4227-4234). Here, we report structures of both M pro -C monomer and dimer. The structure of the M pro -C monomer is almost identical to that of the C-terminal domain in the crystal structure of M pro . Interestingly, the M pro -C dimer structure is characterized by 3D domain-swapping, in which the first helices of the two protomers are interchanged and each is enwrapped by four other helices from the other protomer. Each folding subunit of the M pro -C domain-swapped dimer still has the same general fold as that of the M pro -C monomer. This special dimerization elucidates the structural basis for the observation that there is no exchange between monomeric and dimeric forms of M pro -C and M pro -D7.",
