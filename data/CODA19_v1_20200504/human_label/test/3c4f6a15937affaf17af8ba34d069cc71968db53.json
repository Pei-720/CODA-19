All structures of the newly prepared compounds were characterized by 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, and HRMS spectra. The structures of 2e, 2f, 3d, and 3g were further confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis. These compounds were tested against various strains of DNA and RNA viruses; compounds 4b and 4c showed a modest inhibitory activity against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and compound 4h displayed modest inhibitory activity against Coxsackie virus B4.",
