Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy control subjects (N \u003d 93) and asthmatic children of varying disease severity (N \u003d 66) were characterized by multi-parameter flow cytometry.",

Using a multivariate model, increased Treg cell frequency in children with asthma was most directly associated with inhaled corticosteroid use, and not asthma severity, allergic sensitization, or atopic status of the asthma. Conclusion: We conclude that low dose, local airway administration of corticosteroids is sufficient to impact the frequency of Treg cells in the peripheral blood. These data highlight the importance of considering medication exposure when studying Treg cells and suggest inhaled corticosteroid use in asthmatics may improve disease control through increased Treg cell frequency.",
