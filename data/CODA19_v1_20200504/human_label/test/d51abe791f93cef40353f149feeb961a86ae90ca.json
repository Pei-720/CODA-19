Control of the disease with live attenuated vaccines administered via eye drop build upon immune responses generated by the eye-associated lymphoid tissues. The aim of this study was to assess cytokine and lymphocyte changes in the conjunctiva-associated lymphoid tissues (CALT) and Harderian gland (HG) stimulated by the ocular inoculation of the ILTV chicken embryo origin (CEO) vaccine strain and virulent strain 63140. This study offers strong evidence to support the roles that the CALT and HG play in the development of protective ILTV immune responses. It supports the premise that ILTV-mediated immunomodulation favors the B cell response over those of T cells. Further, it provides evidence that expansions of CD8α + cells, with the concomitant expression of the Granzyme A gene, are key to reducing viral genomes in the CALT and halting ILTV cytolytic replication in the conjunctiva. Ultimately, this study revealed that the early upregulation of interleukin (IL)-12p40 and Interferon (IFN)-γ cytokine genes, which shape the antigen-specific cell-mediated immune responses, retarded the decline of virus replication, and enhanced the development of lesions in the conjunctiva epithelium.",

Therefore, assessing the changes in immune cell populations within the eye-associated lymphoid tissues (CALT and HG) after ILTV exposure may help identify important features occurring in mucosal tissues that are involved in ILTV pathogenesis and host immune responses. To this end, the objective of the present study was to assess differences in immune cell dynamics by monitoring the number of T and B lymphocytes, the number of MHC class I and MHC class II antigen surface expressing cells, and transcript profile of interleukin (IL)-12p40, interferon (IFN)-γ, and Granzyme A genes in CALT and HG after ocular inoculation with the CEO vaccine strain or the virulent strain 63140.
