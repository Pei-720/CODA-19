      "original_text": "The members of the Order Nidovirales share a similar genome organization with two overlapping nonstructural polyproteins encoded in the 5′ two-thirds and the structural proteins encoded in the 3′ third. They also express their 3′ region proteins from a nested set of 3′ co-terminal subgenomic messenger RNAs (sg mRNAs). Some but not all of the Nidovirus sg mRNAs also have a common 5′ leader sequence that is acquired by a discontinuous RNA synthesis mechanism regulated by multiple 3′ body transcription regulating sequences (TRSs) and the 5′ leader TRS. Initial studies detected a single major body TRS for each 3′ sg mRNA with a few alternative functional TRSs reported. The recent application of advanced techniques, such as next generation sequencing and ribosomal profiling, in studies of arteriviruses and coronaviruses has revealed an expanded sg mRNA transcriptome and coding capacity.",
