      "original_text": "Linear plasmids with almost identical compact genetic organization have been found in the cytoplasm of yeast species from nine genera. We employed pGKL1,2 plasmids from Kluyveromyces lactis as a model to investigate the previously unstudied transcriptome of yeast cytoplasmic linear plasmids. We performed 5\u0027 and 3\u0027 RACE analysis of all the pGKL1,2 mRNAs and found them not 3\u0027 polyadenylated and containing mostly uncapped 5\u0027 poly(A) leaders that are not complementary to the plasmid DNA. The degree of 5\u0027 capping and/or 5\u0027 polyadenylation is specific to each gene and is controlled by the corresponding promoter regions. We refined the description of the pGKL1,2 promoters and found new alternative promoters of several genes. We also provide evidence that K2ORF3 encodes an mRNA cap guanine-N 7 -methyltransferase and that 5\u0027 capped pGKL1,2 transcripts contain N 7 -methylated caps. Translation of pGKL1,2 transcripts is enhanced in lsm1Δ and pab1Δ strains and is independent of eIF4E and Pab1 translation factors. We suggested a model of a primitive regulation of pGKL1,2 plasmids gene expression where degree of 5\u0027 mRNA capping, degree of 5\u0027 non-template polyadenylation and presence of negative regulators as PAB1 and Lsm1 play an important role. Our data also suggest a close relationship between linear plasmids and poxviruses. doi: bioRxiv preprint 4 synthesized in a template-independent manner. We show that plasmid promoters directly determine the formation of the mRNA 5\u0027 end leaders and their capping, pointing to a possible role of the plasmid RNA polymerase in this unusual phenomenon. We also provide the first evidence that MTase is an essential part of the K2Orf3p enzyme and that capped pGKL mRNAs are methylated at the N 7 position of the terminal guanosine moiety. Using in vitro and in vivo approaches, we demonstrate that translation of plasmid-specific mRNAs is independent of major cellular cap-binding proteins, translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), and the Pab1 and Lsm1 proteins that were speculated to be possible translational enhancers and/or stabilizers of cellular and viral mRNAs bearing 5\u0027 poly(A) stretches (38,39). Our results thus suggest the existence of a novel translation initiation mechanism.",
