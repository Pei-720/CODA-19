The amphiregulin-producing cells were basophils, as judged by morphology and expression of CD203c and CD123 (IL-3 receptor alpha chain). Activated mouse basophils also produced amphiregulin. Amphiregulin expression by basophils in response to anti-TCR stimulation required IL-3 produced by T cells, and IL-3 alone induced high levels of amphiregulin expression by purified basophils. Amphiregulin was expressed at much higher levels when human basophils were stimulated by IL-3 than by IgE cross-linking, whereas the opposite was true for IL-4 expression and histamine release. Heparin-binding Epidermal Growth Factor-like growth factor was also expressed by IL-3-stimulated human basophils. PBMC from asthmatic human subjects contained significantly higher numbers of basophils able to produce amphiregulin, compared to allergic or non-allergic controls.",
