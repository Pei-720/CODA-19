No fever was recorded at admission. The child had a heart rate of 170 beats/min (reference range 75-130 beats/min) and a respiratory rate of 50 breaths/min (reference range 25-30 breaths/min). He experienced severe respiratory distress and was transferred to the intensive care unit. A chest radiograph showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrations and atelectasis of the upper right lobe (Figure). His serum C-reactive protein level was 1 mg/L, and his leukocyte count was 19.6 ×10 9 /L. He was treated with intravenous cefuroxime, clarithromycin, and methylpred-nisolone. Tracheal intubation and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed. Cultures of blood and BAL sample did not grow bacteria.",
