      "original_text": "The human olfactory system is a mucosal surface and a major portal of entry for respiratory and neurotropic pathogens into the body. Understanding how the human nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) halts the progression of pathogens into the lower respiratory tract or the central nervous system is key for developing effective cures. Although traditionally mice have been used as the gold-standard model for the study of human nasal diseases, mouse models present important caveats due to major anatomical and functional differences of the human and murine olfactory system and NALT. We summarize the NALT anatomy of different animal groups that have thus far been used to study host-pathogen interactions at the olfactory mucosa and to test nasal vaccines. The goal of this review is to highlight the strengths and limitations of each animal model of nasal immunity and to identify the areas of research that require further investigation to advance human health.",
