The 3C protease has been regarded as a valid target due to its structural similarity among different picornaviruses and minimal sequence similarity with host proteins; therefore, the development of potent inhibitors against the 3C protease as an antiviral drug is ongoing. Duck hepatitis A virus (DHAV) belongs to the Picornavidea family and is a major threat to the poultry industry. To date, little is known about the roles of the DHAV 3C protease plays during infection.",

The inhibitory activity of rupintrivir against the DHAV 3C protease was further evaluated.

We used fluorimetric based kinetic analysis to determine kinetic parameters, and V max and K m values were determined to be 16.52 nmol/min and 50.78 μM, respectively. Rupintrivir was found to exhibit inhibitory activity against the DHAV 3C protease. Using polyclonal antibody and an indirect immunofluorescence microscopy assay (IFA), it was determined that the DHAV 3C protease was found in the nucleus during infection. In addition, the DHAV 3C protease can enter into the nucleus without the cooperation of viral proteins.",
