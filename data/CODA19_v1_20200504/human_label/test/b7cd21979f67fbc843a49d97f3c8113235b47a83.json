      "original_text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a highly fatal systemic disease in cats, caused by feline coronavirus (FCoV) infection. FCoV usually has little clinical signifi cance; however, a mutation of this avirulent virus (feline enteric coronavirus) to a virulent type (FIP virus) can lead to FIP incidence. It is diffi cult to diagnose FIP, since the viruses cannot be distinguished using serological or virological methods. Recently, genetic techniques, such as RT-PCR, have been conducted for FIP diagnosis. In this chapter, the reliability of RT-PCR and procedures used to determine FCoV infection as part of antemortem FIP diagnosis is described.",
