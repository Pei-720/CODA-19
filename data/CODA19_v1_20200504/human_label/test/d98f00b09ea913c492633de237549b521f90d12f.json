      "original_text": "To improve understanding of severe group A streptococcal (GAS) disease in Europe and achieve an integrated picture of these infections, the Strep-EURO project comprising 11 countries started in September 2002. A European case definition for severe invasive GAS disease was agreed upon amongst all participants. In order to obtain nation-wide coverage, information on the project was given to infectioncontrol units, relevant hospitals and microbiological laboratories. A clinical questionnaire containing background identification data, possible predisposing factors, portal of entry of infection, epidemiological risk factors, source of isolate, clinical condition, complications and outcome, was used for each case. Enhanced surveillance of GAS invasive disease commenced on 1 January 2003 for a two-year period. By July 2004, over 5000 invasive GAS isolates were collected of which more than 3000 were from UK. The disease incidence rate in the different countries seems to vary from 2 to 3.8 per 100,000 population. Molecular methods for typing and clonal identification of clinical isolates were used. An overall increase of new invasive types is noted. Higher emm types (77, 78, 81, 82, 83, 87, 89) were thus reported from almost all partners, in contrast to types 1, 3 and 28 being predominant for several years. In Sweden, for example, emm types 81 and 89 accounted for a majority of isolates. This unusual change of type distribution in Europe is of serious concern. A high level of MLS antibiotic resistance in some countries (France, Italy) and very frequent tetracycline resistance in almost all countries was noted. Furthermore, pathogenic aspects of severe GAS disease, such as proteolytic activation of the contact system, and selected virulence factors, such as surface proteins and superantigens, were investigated. A new Strep-EURO website (www.strep-euro.lu.se) was constructed and updated regularly. The website is linked with other, relevant websites and contains both an \"intra-net\" site accessible to those persons participating within the project, and an \"extra-net\" site for the general public. A central database for severe GAS cases, receiving clinical and laboratory information from the local databases was also established. Strep-EURO has now created a European network for epidemiological analysis and surveillance of severe streptococcal disease in ten EU and one Associated Countries.",

Mice (N \u003d 15) were inoculated using an aerosolisation device for 45 min. Five mice were sacrificed at day 0, 7 and 14 of the study. C. burnetii detection was performed by Light Cycler Nested PCR assay in lungs and blood samples. Antibodies to phases I and II C. burnetii whole cell antigens were determined in the sera by immunofluorescence testing. Inflammatory reactions in lungs and spleen samples were investigated by histological and immunohistological analysis. C. burnetii was detected by genomic amplification in the blood of mice sacrificed at day 7 and in all lung samples. All infected mice sacrificed at day 14 had developed antibodies to C. burnetii phases I and II antigens (titer of 1:1600). Inflammatory infiltrates were seen in the lungs of mice sacrificed at day 7 and 14, bacteria were detected by immunohistochemistry in the macrophages cells. In our study, we demonstrated that the infection first resulted in an interstitial pneumonia. C. burnetii was then released and may spread hematogenously to other organs. As a conclusion, this murine model of aerosol-induced experimental Q fever is the first step for studies on acute Q fever, especially in terms of pathogenicity.",
