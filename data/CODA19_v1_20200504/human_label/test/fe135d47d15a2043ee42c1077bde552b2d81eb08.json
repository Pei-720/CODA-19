The ability of short RNA sequences to modulate gene expression has provided a powerful tool with which to study gene function and is set to revolutionize the treatment of disease. Remarkably, despite being just one decade from its discovery, the phenomenon is already being used therapeutically in human clinical trials, and biotechnology companies that focus on RNA-interference-based therapeutics are already publicly traded.",

Shortly thereafter, short dsRNAs -or short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (reviewed in ref. 1 ) -were generated artificially and used to demonstrate that this process also occurs in mammalian cells, usually, but not always, without triggering the innate immune sys tem, which normally recognizes RNAs as part of an antiviral defence mechanism (see page 421).
