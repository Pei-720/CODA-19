      "original_text": "Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes tremendous economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide. Different serotypes of this virus show little cross-protection. The present study investigated the genotypic relationship between CK/CH/LDL/97I-type strains and reference IBVs based on S1 gene comparisons and the protection provided by vaccination with commercial vaccines and attenuated homologous and heterologous strains. Phylogenetic analysis and the comparison of S1 showed that CK/CH/LDL/97I-type virus might be a new serotype compared to vaccine strains and other types of IBV isolates in China. Protection efficacy was evaluated by morbidity, mortality, and virus re-isolation from the challenged chicks. Complete protection by IBV vaccination was provided by the homologous strain but sufficient respiratory protection was not provided by the commercial vaccines. Heterologous strains against CK/CH/LDL/97I challenge and the development of a vaccine against CK/CH/LDL/97I-type IBV will be necessary to control infectious bronchitis disease in poultry. Further development of the attenuated CK/CH/LDL/97I strain may provide a valuable contribution towards this goal.",
