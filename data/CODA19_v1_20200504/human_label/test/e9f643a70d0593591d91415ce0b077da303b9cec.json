      "original_text": "RT-PCR/ESI-MS has previously demonstrated the capability to detect and identify respiratory viral pathogens in nasopharyngeal swabs. This study expands on previous research by performing a prospective evaluation of RT-PCR/ESI-MS to detect and identify Influenza A and B viruses compared to Prodesse ProFlu Plus and combined ProFlu Plus and Cepheid Xpert Flu. ProFlu Plus was also used as a gold standard for comparison for respiratory syncytial virus detection. Using ProFlu Plus as a gold standard, RT-PCR/ESI-MS had sensitivity and specificity of 82.1% (23/28) and 100% (258/258), respectively, for Influenza A, 100% (16/16) and 99.6% (269/270), respectively for Influenza B, and 88.6% (39/44) and 99.6% (241/242) for any Influenza virus. Using matching results from ProFlu Plus and Xpert Flu as a gold standard, RT-PCR/ESI-MS had 85.2% (23/27) and 100% (259/259) sensitivity and specificity respectively for Influenza A, 100% (14/14) and 99.6% (270/272), respectively for Influenza B virus. Overall, RT-PCR/ESI-MS was not as sensitive as the combined gold standard of ProFlu Plus and Xpert Flu, although it has the capability of detecting other respiratory viruses.",
