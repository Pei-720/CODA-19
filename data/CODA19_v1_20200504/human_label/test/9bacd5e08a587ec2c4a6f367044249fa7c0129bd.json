Unfortunately, no antivirals or vaccines are currently available, and therefore efficient and safe antivirals are urgently needed. We developed a high throughput screen to discover small molecule probes that inhibit virus infection of Vero E6 cells. A primary screen of a 13,001 compound library at a 10 µM final concentration was conducted using the 384-well format. Z′ values ranged from 0.54-0.83 with a median of 0.74. Average S/B was 17 and S/N for each plate ranged from 10.8 to 23.9. Twenty-six compounds showed a dose response in the HT screen and were further evaluated in a time of addition assay and in a titer reduction",
