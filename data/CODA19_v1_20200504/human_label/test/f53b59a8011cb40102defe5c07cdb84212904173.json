The results showed that two NO-generating compounds, S-nitroso-L-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) and L-arginine (LA), at a noncytotoxic concentration could reduce PPV replication in a dosedependent manner and that this anti-PPV effect could be reversed by the NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor N-nitro-Larginine methyl ester (L-NAME). By assaying the steps of the PPV life cycle, we also show that NO inhibits viral DNA and protein synthesis. This experiment provides a frame of reference for the study of the anti-viral mechanism of NO.",

It has been shown to have antimicrobial activity for several bacteria and protozoa and for some viruses [1, 7, 15, 17, 23, 25] . It also has been demonstrated that NO hinders the productive infection of several animal virus, including vaccinia virus (VV) [4], influenza virus [29], Japanese encephalitis virus [17, 26, 31] , Marek\u0027s disease virus [31] , and murine Friend leukemia retrovirus [2] . NO exerts its inhibitory effect on viral infection by interfering with specific stages in the cycle of viral replication. For example, NO inhibits viral DNA synthesis, late protein translation, and virion assembly, resulting in lower viral yields and more efficient host clearance of the infection [8, 10, 13, 14, 18] . In this study, the inhibitory effect of NO on PPV replication and the effect of NO on different stages of the PPV replication cycle were investigated in vitro.",
