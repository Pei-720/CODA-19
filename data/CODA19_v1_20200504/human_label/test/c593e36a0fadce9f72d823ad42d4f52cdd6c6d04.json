SARS-CoV M pro is composed of a catalytic N-terminal domain and an a-helical C-terminal domain linked by a long loop. Even though the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV M pro adopts a similar chymotrypsin-like fold as that of piconavirus 3C protease, the extra C-terminal domain is required for SARS-CoV M pro to be enzymatically active. Here, we reported the NMR assignments of the SARS-CoV M pro N-terminal domain alone, which are essential for its solution structure determination.",
