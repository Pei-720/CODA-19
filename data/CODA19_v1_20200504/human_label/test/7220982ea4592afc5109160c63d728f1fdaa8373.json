      "original_text": "Background: Burden of disease can be used to prioritize the healthcare budget allocation. We analyzed the research and development (R\u0026D) budget of the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) in 2018 and compared the results with those of the 2015 Korean National Burden of Disease (KNBD) study. Methods: The 2018 MOHW R\u0026D Project integrated implementation plan was used to analyze the R\u0026D budget of the MOHW. The budget was allocated according to the KNBD disease group and according to the budget lines. The allocated budget was compared with the economic burden and the disability adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2015. Also, for budget targets for risk factors, DALYs of attributable risk factors were compared with corresponding budgets. Results: In 2018, the MOHW major R\u0026D budget of USD 435.1 million accounted for 3% of the total government budget. Within the disease specific R\u0026D budget, 35.9% was allocated to communicable disease groups, 64.1% to non-communicable diseases, and 0% to injury and violence. Among level 2 disease groups, neoplasm was ranked first. Among risk factors, climate change and behavioral risk were targeted for R\u0026D. Conclusions: It would be difficult to say that current R\u0026D allocations focus to minimize the burden of disease. A mismatch was observed between the R\u0026D budget and the burden of disease in terms of economic burden and DALYs. There was a similar finding for risk factors R\u0026D. A novel approach for allocating government R\u0026D funding that is based on the goal of minimizing the disease burden in the Korean population should be considered.",
