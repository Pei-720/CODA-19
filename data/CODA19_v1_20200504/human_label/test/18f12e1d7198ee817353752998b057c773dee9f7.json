They are predominantly triggered by infection and up to 64% of exacerbations are associated with colds. 2 The most common respiratory virus detected in the airways at exacerbation is human rhinovirus (HRV), which using molecular techniques has been identifi ed as present in up to 60% of respiratory virus-associated exacerbations. 2, 3 Background: Human rhinovirus (HRV) is the most frequent virus associated with COPD exacerbations. Viral infections increase exacerbation severity and likelihood of hospitalization. As ease of sampling blood makes serum a more practical marker than sputum, we investigated whether changes in serum interferon-g -inducible protein 10 (IP-10) from baseline to exacerbation were higher in airway HRV-positive exacerbations and whether IP-10 levels related to HRV load. Methods: One hundred thirty-six patients with COPD and 70 controls were included over 2 years and 72 exacerbations sampled. HRV positivity and load were determined by reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction in nasopharyngeal swabs and/or sputum at baseline and exacerbation. IP-10 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in serum and compared with HRV load.",
