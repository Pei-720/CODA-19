Lung transplant recipients are at high risk for developing infections caused by bacteria, viruses, and opportunistic fungi, whereas heart transplant recipients are at risk for developing infections caused by these same microorganisms, as well as parasitic infections, including toxoplasmosis and New World trypanosomiasis.
