This article describes a survey on BToV in Brazil carried out on 80 fecal samples from diarrheic young and adult cattle, using a nested-RT-PCR targeting the nucleocapsid (N) gene. BToV was detected in 6.25% (5/80) of stool samples from three different geographic regions. Sequences analysis showed that Brazilian BToVs have a high degree of identity with European and Japanese BToVs and a lower degree of identity with North American Breda 1 strain. These results show that, albeit its low frequency and the scarce number of research on the field, BToV is still present amongst cattle populations.",
