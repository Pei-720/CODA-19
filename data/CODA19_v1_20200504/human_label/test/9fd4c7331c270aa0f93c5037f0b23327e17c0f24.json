The recently described human coronavirus NL63 has not been well investigated among Brazilian patients. We reported the clinical course of an HCoV-NL63 infection in a hospitalised patient suspected of H1N1 2009 infection during the second pandemic wave of influenza activity. A 46-year-old female, health care worker with diabetes and presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI) was admitted to the hospital. During 9 days of influenza-like symptoms, the patient had diabetes decompensation, haemorrhagic pneumonia, rhabdomyolysis, respiratory and renal failure, pericarditis, and brain edema and died. HCoV-NL63 may be a causative agent of previously unexplained respiratory illnesses.",
