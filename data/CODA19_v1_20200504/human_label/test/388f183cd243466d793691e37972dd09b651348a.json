      "original_text": "People most at risk of influenza complications are the elderly with impaired immunity. Clinical picture of influenza virus infection includes symptoms such as chills, increased body temperature, dry cough, chest pain, or dizziness as well as headaches and muscle aches. In the diagnosis of influenza, quick and effective tests are necessary. Sensitive diagnostic methods of molecular biology require more time, but the result firmly confirm or exclude the presence of the genetic material of influenza or other respiratory viruses. Influenza vaccination plays an important role in combating influenza infection. Unfortunately, the awareness of vaccination benefits is insufficient in Poland. In this study we demonstrate the results of examination of 4,507 people aged over 14 years toward the influenza infection in the epidemic season of 2017/18. Most of the confirmed infections were reported in older people aged over 65, a high-risk population group. A low percentage of the vaccinated population may affect an increased number of confirmed influenza viruses in the elderly. The findings demonstrate a need to increase awareness of vaccination benefits, which is particularly essential to avoid influenza infection in the elderly.",
