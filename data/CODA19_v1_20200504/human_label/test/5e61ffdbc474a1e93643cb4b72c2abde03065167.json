      "original_text": "The efficient synthesis of a new series of polyhydroxylated dibenzyl x-(1H-1,2,3-triazol-1yl)alkylphosphonates as acyclic nucleotide analogues is described starting from dibenzyl x-azido-(polyhydroxy)alkylphosphonates and selected alkynes under microwave irradiation. Selected O,O-dibenzylphosphonate acyclonucleotides were transformed into the respective phosphonic acids. All compounds were evaluated in vitro for activity against a broad variety of DNA and RNA viruses and for cytostatic activity against murine leukemia L1210, human T-lymphocyte CEM and human cervix carcinoma HeLa cells. Compound (1S,2S)-16b exhibited antiviral activity against Influenza A H3N2 subtype (EC 50 \u003d 20 lM-visual CPE score; EC 50 \u003d 18 lM-MTS method; MCC \u003e100 lM, CC 50 \u003e100 lM) in Madin Darby canine kidney cell cultures (MDCK), and (1S,2S)-16k was active against vesicular stomatitis virus and respiratory syncytial virus in HeLa cells (EC 50 \u003d 9 and 12 lM, respectively). Moreover, compound (1R,2S)-16l showed activity against both herpes simplex viruses (HSV-1, HSV-2) in HEL cell cultures (EC 50 \u003d 2.9 and 4 lM, respectively) and feline herpes virus in CRFK cells (EC 50 \u003d 4 lM) but at the same time it exhibited cytotoxicity toward uninfected cell (MCC P 4 lM). Several other compounds have been found to inhibit proliferation of L1210, CEM as well as HeLa cells with IC 50 in the 4-50 lM range. Among them compounds (1S,2S)-and (1R,2S)-16l were the most active (IC 50 in the 4-7 lM range).",
