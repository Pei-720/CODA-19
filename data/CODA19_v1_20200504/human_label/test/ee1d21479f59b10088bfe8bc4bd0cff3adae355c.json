      "original_text": "Background: The transmission potential of primary pneumonic plague, caused by Yersinia pestis, is one of the key epidemiological determinants of a potential biological weapon, and requires clarification and time dependent interpretation. Method: This study estimated the reproduction number and its time dependent change through investigations of outbreaks in Mukden, China (1946), and Madagascar (1957). Reconstruction of an epidemic tree, which shows who infected whom, from the observed dates of onset was performed using the serial interval. Furthermore, a likelihood based approach was used for the time inhomogeneous evaluation of the outbreaks for which there was scarcity of cases. Results: According to the estimates, the basic reproduction number, R 0 , was on the order of 2.8 to 3.5, which is higher than previous estimates. The lower 95% confidence intervals of R 0 exceeded unity. The effective reproduction number declined below unity after control measures were introduced in Mukden, and before the official implementation in Madagascar. Conclusion: While the time course of the latter outbreak could be explained by intrinsic factors and stochasticity in this remote and scarcely populated area, the former in Mukden suggests the possible continued chains of transmission in highly populated areas. Using the proposed methods, the who infected whom information permitted the evaluation of the time inhomogeneous transmission potential in relation to public health measures. The study also tackles the problem of statistical estimation of R 0 based on similar information, which was previously performed simply by counting the number of secondary transmissions regardless of time. P lague has one of the earliest histories of use as a biological weapon; the Japanese army attempted to drop plague infected fleas over populated areas during the second world war, 1 2 and scientists in the former Soviet Union were incriminated of creating an aerosolised form during the cold war era and manufacturing large quantities of allegedly engineered multidrug resistant strains. 3 4 Although primary pneumonic plague (PPP) is highly fatal and its aetiological agent, Yersinia pestis, is easily accessible, 5 epidemiological studies and investigations of intervention strategies are rather limited compared with smallpox. Besides zoonotic infection, which is mainly maintained by wild rodents and fleas as the natural cycle of transmission, intentional release of aerosolised Y pestis resulting in person to person transmission is the most plausible bioterrorism threat. 3 The proportion of PPP associated case fatalities can reach almost 100% without appropriate antibiotic treatment within 24 hours after onset of illness. 6 Despite the recent decline in the annual incidence, 7 sporadic outbreaks such as the one recently seen in the Democratic Republic of Congo are still a threat. 8 Human susceptibility to plague is thought to be universal and the effectiveness of existing vaccines has not been proved. 9 Thus, given the availability of the pathogen, the actual history of its use as a biological weapon, and its potential for huge disasters, epidemiological investigation of PPP is of outstanding importance for response planning of effective control measures.",

Precise estimates of R(t) are of importance for outbreak evaluation and management; R(t) shows time dependent variation with the decline in susceptible people (intrinsic factors) and with the implementation of control measures (extrinsic factors). It is possible to estimate R(t) directly by closely monitoring the network of transmission; that is, by determining who infected whom. 12 Moreover, a recently proposed method using serial intervals, the time intervals between infection of one person and infection of others by this person (or the time from symptom onset in an index case to symptom onset in secondary cases), permits reasonable estimates of R(t) when such information is unavailable, but where an independent source of infection is assumed. 12 14 The notations \u0027\u0027generation time\u0027\u0027 or \u0027\u0027generation interval\u0027\u0027 have also been used to suggest serial intervals in other studies. 12 13 However, the estimation procedures of R 0 and R(t) from outbreaks where the network of transmission is only partly known are yet to be developed. This is of practical importance as we usually have only partial information on who infected whom. The purpose of this study is to estimate R 0 and R(t), based on fully or partly known transmission network (who infected whom). We use serial intervals to reconstruct epidemic trees and propose an evaluation method based on the transmission network, tackling previous technical problems in interpreting the transmission potential. 640 www.jech.com 30 20 25",
