      "original_text": "The nucleolus is a subnuclear structure of eukaryocytes. It was thought that nucleolus only participates in the biogenesis and processing of rRNA. However, more and more evidence shows that it has many other functions, such as tRNA precursor processing, stress sensing and it is also involved in gene silencing, senescence and cell cycle regulation. Here, we summarize the recent understandings about the nucleolar functions, the regulation of nucleolar localization of proteins and the role that the nucleolus plays in virus infection, in which some related studies of Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) US11, UL24 and bovine herpesvirus-1 infected cell protein 27 (BICP27) carried out in our lab will also be included.",
