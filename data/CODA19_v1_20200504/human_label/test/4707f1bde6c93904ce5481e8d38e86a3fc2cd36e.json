      "original_text": "Salmonella Typhimurium is one of the most important zoonotic pathogens worldwide and a major cause of economic losses in the pig production chain. The emergence of multi-drug resistant strains over the past years has led to considerations about an enhanced surveillance of bacterial food contamination. Currently, ELISA is the method of choice for high throughput identification of S. Typhimurium. The sensitivity and specificity of this assay might be improved by application of new diagnostic antibodies. We focused on plant-based expression of candidate diagnostic TM43-E10 antibodies discovered using as antigen the S. Typhimurium OmpD protein. The scFv-TM43-E10 and scFv-Fc-TM43-E10 antibody derivatives have been successfully produced in N. benthamiana using a deconstructed movementdeficient PVX vector supplemented with the gb silencing suppressor from Poa semilatent virus. The plant-made antibodies showed the same antigen-binding specificity as that of the microbial/mammalian cell-produced counterparts and could recognize the OmpD antigen in S. Typhimurium infected plant samples.",
