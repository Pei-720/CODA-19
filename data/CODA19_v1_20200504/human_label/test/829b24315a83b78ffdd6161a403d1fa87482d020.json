      "original_text": "The Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) nonstructural protein 2 (nsP2) cysteine protease is essential for viral replication and is involved in the cytopathic effects (CPE) of the virus. The VEEV nsP2 protease is a member of MEROPS Clan CN and characteristically contains a papain-like protease linked to an S-adenosyl-L-methionine dependent RNA methyltransferase (SAM MTase) domain. The protease contains an alternative active site motif, 475 NVCWAK 480 , which differs from papain\u0027s (CGS 25 CWAFS), and the enzyme lacks a transition state (TS) stabilizing residue homologous to Q19 in papain. To understand the roles of conserved residues in catalysis we determined the structure of the free enzyme, and the first structure of an inhibitorbound alphaviral protease. The peptide-like E64d inhibitor was found to bind beneath a β-hairpin at the interface of the SAM MTase and protease domains. His-546 adopted a conformation that differed from that found in the free enzyme, each conformer may assist in leaving group departure of either the amine or Cys thiolate during the catalytic cycle. Interestingly, E64c (200 μM), the carboxylic acid form of the E64d ester, did not inhibit the nsP2 protease. To identify key residues involved in substrate binding, a number of mutants were analyzed. Mutation of the motif residue, N475A, led to a 24-fold reduction in k cat /K m , and the conformation of this residue did not change after inhibition. N475 forms a hydrogen bond with R662 in the SAM MTase domain, and the R662A and R662K mutations both led to 16-fold reductions in k cat /K m . N475 forms the base of the P1 binding site and likely orients the substrate for nucleophilic attack or plays a role in product * CORRESPONDING AUTHOR FOOTNOTE.

It is a positive-sense RNA virus (1). The zoonotic arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) can be transmitted via mosquitos to birds, horses, rodents, humans and other vertebrate species (2;3). Equine are unusually susceptible to the virus, and fatality rates for horses are 20-80 % (3). VEEV is both neuroinvasive and neurotropic; the virus replicates in both lymphoid tissue and in the brain (3;4). VEEV causes acute viral infections which are typically resolved by innate and adaptive immune responses, however, neurological symptoms occur in approximately 14 % of infected humans and ~1 % of cases result in lethal encephalitis (3;5). The more deadly Eastern (EEEV, 36 % mortality (6)) and Western (WEEV, 10 % mortality (7)) equine encephalitis viruses share 53 % and 46 % sequence identity with VEEV, respectively. The related Old World alphaviruses such as Chikungunya (CHIKV), have only been associated with fever, arthralgia, and skin rashes (8;9). VEEV viral particles are unusual in that they are highly resistant to desiccation and can be stably lyophilized and aerosolized (3;10-12).
