Various IBV isolates have been classified into several distinct serotypes by the serological neutralization test [3, 4] . Some of them, such as the Gray, Holte [7] , and Australian T strain [2] have been reported to cause nephritis and nephrosis. Recently, there have been frequent IBV outbreaks in Japan characterized by following signs: depression, dehydration, diarrhea, and death. The kidneys of those chickens were swollen with prominent tubules and the ureters distended, which were diagnosed as a tubutointerstitial nephritis.",
