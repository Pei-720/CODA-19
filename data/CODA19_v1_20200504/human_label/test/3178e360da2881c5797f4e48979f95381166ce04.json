New human pathogens often emerge or re-emerge from an animal reservoir, emphasizing the central role that nonhuman reservoirs play in human infectious diseases. Pathogens can also re-emerge with new characteristics, such as multidrug resistance, or in different places, such as Ebola virus in West Africa in 2013 and Zika virus in Brazil in 2015, to cause new epidemics. Most human pathogens have a history of evolution in which they first emerge and cause epidemics, become unstably adapted, re-emerge periodically and then e without intervention e eventually become endemic, with the potential for future outbreaks.",
