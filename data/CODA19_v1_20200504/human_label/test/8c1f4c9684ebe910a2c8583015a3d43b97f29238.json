      "original_text": "Aim: Nurses\u0027 attitudes towards perinatal bereavement care are explored by identifying profiles of nurses working in a Hong Kong Obstetrics and Gynaecology (OAG) unit. Relationships between nurses\u0027 attitudes towards bereavement support, need for bereavement training and hospital policy are explored. Research method: 110 nurses recruited from the OAG unit of a large Hong Kong public hospital completed a structured questionnaire. Outcome measures: Attitudes towards perinatal bereavement support; required support and training needs for nurses on bereavement care. Results: Two-step cluster analysis yielded two clusters. Cluster A consisted of 55.5% (n ¼ 61) and cluster B consisted of 44.5% (n ¼ 49) of nurses. Cluster A nurses were younger, had less OAG experience, more junior ranking and less education than cluster B nurses. Cluster B nurses had additional midwifery and bereavement care training, personal grieving experiences and experience handling grieving clients. The majority held positive bereavement care attitudes. Significant differences towards perinatal bereavement support were found. Only 25.5% (n ¼ 28) had bereavement related training. Attitudes towards bereavement care were positively correlated with training needs (r s ¼ 0:59) and hospital policy support (r s ¼ 0:60). Conclusion: Hong Kong nurses emphasized need for increased bereavement care knowledge and experience, improved communication skills, and greater hospital and team members\u0027 support. Findings may be used to improve support of nurses, to ensure sensitive bereavement care in perinatal settings, and to enhance nursing curricula.",
