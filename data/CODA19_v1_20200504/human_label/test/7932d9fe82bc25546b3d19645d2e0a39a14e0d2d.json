      "original_text": "Uveitis is the inflammation of any or all parts of the vascular tunic of the eye; the vascular tunic includes the iris, the ciliary body, and choroid. A good knowledge base, up-to-date reference materials, and good instruments will improve the diagnosis of uveitis. Feline uveitis can be caused by numerous infectious agents in addition to neoplasia and less likely trauma. The infectious causes most commonly associated with feline uveitis include feline leukemia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, feline infectious peritonitis, systemic fungal infections, toxoplasmosis, and bartonellosis. Neoplastic causes of uveitis can be primary or secondary. Iris melanoma is the most common primary uveal neoplasia and trauma-associated sarcoma is the second most common primary uveal neoplasia. Treatment for the clinical signs of anterior uveitis include topical steroidal or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, parasympatholytic agents for ciliary spasm, to keep the pupil dilated, and to prevent posterior synechia. Posterior uveitis should be treated with systemic medications that will address the underlying cause. Enucleation of blind, painful eyes not responsive to medications is a means to alleviate the animal\u0027s discomfort and to further diagnose the underlying cause.
