      "original_text": "Objectives: Regulatory cytokines are associated with viral infection. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relation between serum regulatory cytokines concentrations and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease. Methods: We enrolled 325 children aged \u003c 24 months who were diagnosed with acute respiratory tract infection. Twenty age-matched healthy children were enrolled as controls. Nasopharyngeal swabs were analyzed to identify virus by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and blood samples were taken to quantify the regulatory cytokine concentrations, including interleukin (IL)-35, IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 using the Bio-Plex immunoassay or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: RSV disease was associated with a great regulatory cytokine response than healthy children, among 89 RSV-infected patients, serum IL-35 (P \u003d .0001) and IL-10 (P \u003d .006) was significantly elevated in comparison with healthy controls. Young children (0 \u003c age ≤6 months) with RSV infection had significantly lower IL-35 and IL-10 expression but needed more oxygen therapy and more severe disease comparing with older children (12 \u003c age \u003c 24 months). Comparing with mild group, the expression levels of IL-10 were significantly lower in children with moderate and severe disease (P \u003d .012 and P \u003d .005, respectively). And levels of IL-10 was inversely associated with total duration of RSV infection symptoms (r \u003d − 0.311, P \u003d .019). Conclusion: Children with RSV infected had increased serum regulatory cytokine IL-10 and IL-35 concentrations. Elevated expression of IL-10 and IL-35 were contributed to protect hypoxia and reduce the severity of disease.",
