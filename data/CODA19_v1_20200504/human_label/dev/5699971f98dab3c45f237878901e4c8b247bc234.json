The incidence was 5 cases/10 000 admissions and 44 cases/10 000 admissions to our adult and pediatric hospitals, respectively. Only 6.8% of cases were due to influenza. Although 63% of cases occurred during the fall and winter, such infections were identified throughout the year. Five (13%) nosocomial respiratory viral infections occurred in 2 adult and 3 pediatric patients who died during the hospitalization.",
