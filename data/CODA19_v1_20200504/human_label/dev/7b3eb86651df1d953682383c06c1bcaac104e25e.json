The percent agreement between MAP and clinical results was 97% for influenza A (73/75), 100% (21/21) for influenza B, 100% (6/6) for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and 80% (4/5) for negative specimens. The approximate limit of detection of the MAP was 30 copies/assay for RSV and 1500 copies/assay for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.",
