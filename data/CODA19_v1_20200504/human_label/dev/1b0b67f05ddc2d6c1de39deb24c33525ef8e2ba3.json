      "original_text": "Objectives: Subsidy for influenza vaccination is often provided to the elderly in order to encourage them to receive a flu shot in developed countries. However, its effect on uptake rate, i.e., price elasticity of demand, has not been well studied. Methods: Japan\u0027s decentralised vaccination programme allows observation of various pairs in price and uptake rate of flu shots among the elderly by the municipality from 2001/2002 to 2004/2005 season. We combine our sample survey data (n \u003d 281), which monitor price, subsidy and uptake rate, with published data on local characteristics in order to estimate price elasticity of demand with panel model. Results: We find price elasticity of demand for influenza vaccine: nearly zero in nationwide, nearly zero in urban area, and −1.07 in rural area.",
