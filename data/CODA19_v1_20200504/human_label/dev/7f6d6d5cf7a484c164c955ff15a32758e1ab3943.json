      "original_text": "The Postgraduate Year (PGY) Program allows doctors-in-training to learn about the diagnosis, treatment and nursing of various common, general diseases. These items form the core curriculum and are mostly learned through caring for patients and clinical teaching. Doctorsin-training are evaluated for their knowledge through written tests or assignments, based on which the effectiveness of their training is also assessed; however, this generally produces a negative learning attitude among them. So we introduced the flipped classroom into PGY training program to change PGY students\u0027 learning behavior. Although the flipped classroom is highly valued and has been practiced by teachers in schools of various levels, very few attempts have been made until now to report the learning outcomes achieved through the flipped classroom by means of rigorous research methods. Therefore we tried to employed Ajzen and Fishbein\u0027s (1980) theory of reasoned action and Bandura\u0027s self-efficacy to predict and explain the participants\u0027 behavioral intention when participating in the core curriculum learning of the flipped classroom and to assess the change in students\u0027 learning behavior and learning effectiveness. From August 2013 to July 2014, 39 PGY students from the General Surgery of the Tri-Service General Hospital were selected as the participants of this study. The control group included 43 students of the previous year, that is, the year before the intervention of the flipped classroom. A comparative analysis was performed. The questionnaire\u0027s related matrices indicated highest correlation between self-efficacy and behavioral intention (r \u003d 0.491, P \u003c 0.01), followed by attitude (r \u003d 0.365, P \u003c 0.01) and subjective norms (r \u003d 0.360, P \u003c 0.01.) All three showed positive correlations with behavioral intention; among attitude, subjective norms, and self-efficacy, the pairwise correlations also reached significance level. The flipped classroom can indeed change PGY students\u0027 the learning behavior from \"passive learning\" to \"active learning.\" PLOS ONE |",
