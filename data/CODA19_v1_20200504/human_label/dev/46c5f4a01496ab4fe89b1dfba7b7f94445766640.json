Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was used to predict the trend of confirmed cases. Stata version 12 were used. Results: Parameters used for ARIMA were (2,1,0) for Mainland China, ARIMA (2,2,2) for Italy , ARIMA(1,0,0) for South Korea, ARIMA (2,3,0) for Iran, and ARIMA(3,1,0) for Thailand. Mainland China and Thailand had almost a stable trend. The trend of South Korea was decreasing and will become stable in near future. Iran and Italy had unstable trends. Conclusions: Mainland China and Thailand were successful in haltering COVID-19 epidemic. Investigating their protocol in this control like quarantine should be in the first line of other countries\u0027 program",
