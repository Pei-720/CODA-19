      "original_text": "a-1-Acid glycoprotein Flow cytometry Feline infectious peritonitis a b s t r a c t Feline a1-acid glycoprotein (fAGP) modifies both its serum concentration and its glycan moiety during diseases. fAGP is hyposialylated in cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), but not in clinically healthy cats or in cats with other diseases. This study was aimed to determine whether hyposialylated fAGP influences phagocytosis. A flow cytometric method based on ingestion of fluoresceinated bacteria and adapted to feline blood was used to assess phagocytosis of leukocytes incubated with \u0027non-pathological\u0027 fAGP (purified from sera with normal concentrations of AGP) and \u0027pathological\u0027 fAGP (purified from sera with \u003e1.5 mg/mL hyposialylated AGP). The flow cytometric method provided repeatable results for neutrophils (coefficients of variations, CVs \u003c15%) but not for monocytes (CVs \u003e 20%) which had also a high individual variability. Compared with saline solution and with non-pathological fAGP, pathological fAGP significantly decreased phagocytosis in neutrophils and monocytes. This study demonstrated that hyposialylated fAGP down-regulates the phagocytic activity of feline neutrophils.",
