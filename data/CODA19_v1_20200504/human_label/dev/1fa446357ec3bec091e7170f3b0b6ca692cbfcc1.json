It was reported during the outbreak of SARS that researchers from HongKong University examined 25 animals representing eight species in a live animal market in southern China and found the virus in six palm civets. The same investigators also found the \"SARS-virus\" in a badger and a raccoon dog (Yahoo on Friday, May 23rd; The Wall Street Journal, May 27th). It is noteworthy that food handlers represented more than 30% of the early SARS cases. It is still not clear yet whether the virus was transmitted from animals to humans or vice versa.",
