      "original_text": "A good knowledge of morbidity profiles among ill-returned travelers is necessary in order to guide their management. We reviewed the medical charts of 230 patients hospitalized in one infectious diseases department in France for presumed travel-related illnesses. The maleto-female ratio was 1.6 and the median age was 33 years (interquartile range [IQR], 25-50). Most patients (70.9%) were returning from sub-Saharan Africa. The median duration of travel was 28 days (IQR, 15-60) and the median time from return of travel to hospitalization was 13 days (IQR, 7-21). Malaria was the most frequent diagnosis (49.1%), which was especially encountered in patients returning from sub-Saharan Africa (95.6%), without adequate chemoprophylaxis (78.2%). Imported diseases at risk of secondary transmission were also diagnosed, including pulmonary tuberculosis (n\u003d8), viral hepatitis (n\u003d 8), typhoid fever (n\u003d6), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (six new diagnosis), non-typhoid salmonellosis (n\u003d 5), severe acute respiratory syndrome, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. This study underlines the need to maintain tropical expertise for infectious diseases physicians, even in Europe.",
