      "original_text": "Purpose of Review Cancer cells utilize extracellular vesicles (EVs) as a means of transferring oncogenic proteins and nucleic acids to other cells to enhance the growth and spread of the tumor. There is an unexpected amount of similarities between these small, membrane-bound particles and enveloped virions, including protein content, physical characteristics (i.e., size and morphology), and mechanisms of entry and exit into target cells. Recent Findings This review describes the attributes shared by both cancer-derived EVs, with an emphasis on breast cancer-derived EVs, and enveloped viral particles and discusses the methods by which virions can utilize the EV pathway as a means of transferring viral material and oncogenes to host cells. Additionally, the possible links between human papilloma virus and its influence on the miRNA content of breast cancer-derived EVs are examined. Summary The rapidly growing field of EVs is allowing investigators from different disciplines to enter uncharted territory. The study of the emerging similarities between cancer-derived EVs and enveloped virions may lead to novel important scientific discoveries.",
