During an epidemic, NIV can free up respirators and other intensive care unit equipment for patients with respiratory insufficiency whose survival depends exclusively on invasive ventilation. Some guidelines have indicated that NIV is potentially hazardous and should not be recommended for use during epidemics, given the perceived potential risk of transmission from aerosolized pathogen dispersion to other patients or medical staff. Conversely, some reports of previous epidemics describe NIV as a very efficient and safe modality of respiratory support, if strict infection control measures are implemented.",
