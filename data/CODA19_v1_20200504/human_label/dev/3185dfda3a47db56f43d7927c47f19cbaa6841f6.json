We also compared the bat JEV isolates with other JEV isolates available from GenBank to determine their genetic similarity. We found a high genetic homogeneity among the bat JEVs isolated in different geographical areas from various bat species at different time periods. All eight bat JEV isolates belonged to genotype III. The mean evolutionary rate of bat JEV isolates was lower than those of isolates of other origin, but this difference was not statistically significant. Based on these results, we presume that the bat JEV isolates might be evolutionarily conserved. The eight bat JEV isolates were phylogenetically similar to mosquito BN19 and human Liyujie isolates of JEV. These results indicate that bats might be involved in natural cycle of JEV.",
