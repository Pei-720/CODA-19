We collected samples during two consecutive winters in each study area. We found no relationship between FCM concentrations and age, sex or social status of individuals. At the group level, our results suggest that breeding pair permanency and the loss of pack members through processes different from dispersal may importantly impact stress levels in wolves. We measured higher FCM levels in comparatively small packs living in sympatry with a population of free-ranging dogs. Lastly, our results indicate that FCM concentrations are associated with endoparasitic infections of individuals. groups remains largely unknown in free-ranging social species.

      "original_text": "Wolves are highly social and typically live in family-based packs consisting of a mated pair and their offspring of the past 1 to 4.5 years [44, 45] . In a stable pack, dominance relationships are typically age-graded, with the parents being naturally the top ranking (hereafter \u0027dominant\u0027) individuals, and the only breeding members of the pack [46] . Multiple litters within a group may however occur, particularly when one or both of the original breeders are lost, or in newly founded packs [47] [48] [49] [50] . When former breeders become no longer reproductively active before their death, they may keep taking part in all other activities of the group [46] . Mating season takes place once a year during late winter. Most males and females usually reach sexual maturity as yearlings at about 22 months of age [51, 52] . Despite all sexually mature females of a pack having a normal estrous cycle and ovulating [46, 51, 53] , wolves are essentially monogamous and the breeding partners of established packs often pair for a lifetime [46, 47] . After 61-64 days of gestation [52] , an average of 4-6 pups are born in April-May, which greatly benefit from extended alloparental care by the pack members of both sexes [44, 46] . While growing up in the pack, the offspring learn social communication, hunting and foraging strategies, and gradually take part in the rearing of pups and territorial defense [44, 46] . Most wolves disperse from their natal pack between 9 and 36 months of age [46] , alone or in groups, with little known consistent difference between males and females in dispersal characteristics [44] . Dispersers may be accepted in existing packs, in particular after the loss of a breeding partner [44, 45, 54] . Although packs appear socially less cohesive in summer compared to winter [55], the litter of pups is the social core of the group [44, 56] and the social status of dominant individuals does not change throughout the year. Pack members may repeatedly leave and return to their natal pack at any time of the year, before ultimately dispersing. Dispersal most often takes place in fall, or from mid-winter to early spring, i.e. between the mating and the denning seasons [44] .",
