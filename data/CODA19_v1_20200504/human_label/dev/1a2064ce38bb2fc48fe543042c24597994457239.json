      "original_text": "microRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that regulate many processes within a cell by manipulating protein levels through direct binding to mRNA and influencing translation efficiency, or mRNA abundance. Recent evidence demonstrates that miRNAs can also affect RNA virus replication and pathogenesis through direct binding to the RNA virus genome or through virusmediated changes in the host transcriptome. Here, we review the current knowledge on the interaction between RNA viruses and cellular miRNAs. We also discuss how cell and tissuespecific expression of miRNAs can directly affect viral pathogenesis. Understanding the role of cellular miRNAs during viral infection may lead to the identification of novel mechanisms to block RNA virus replication or cell-specific regulation of viral vector targeting.",

In vertebrates, RNAi functions as an antiviral mechanism in non-differentiated embryonic stem cells only [2, 3] . In differentiated vertebrate somatic cells, type I interferon (IFN; see Glossary) and the antiviral effectors, interferon stimulated genes (ISGs), have evolved to mediate the majority of cellular antiviral responses [4] . The vertebrate RNAi system regulates the function of cellular messenger RNAs (mRNA) through tissue-and cell-specific expression of host cell-encoded microRNAs (miRNAs) that bind messenger RNAs (mRNA) and alter their translation or abundance [5] . To date, there have been \u003e5500 miRNAs predicted throughout the human genome [6] with many limited to specific tissues [5] . Invertebrates also use miRNAs to regulate mRNA translation and control protein abundance (reviewed in [7] ). Recent evidence indicates that host miRNAs also bind to RNA virus genomes, regulating their translation, replication, and altering virus pathogenesis. On the",
