Over the past several years, the evidence base used to inform effective stewardship practices has expanded, and regulatory interest in stewardship programs has increased. Here, we review approaches for established, hospital-based pediatric ASPs to adapt and report standardized metrics, broaden their reach to specialized populations, expand to undertake novel stewardship initiatives, and implement rapid diagnostics to continue their evolution in improving antimicrobial use and patient outcomes.",
