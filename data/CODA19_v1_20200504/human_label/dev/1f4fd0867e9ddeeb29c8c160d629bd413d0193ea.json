The diarrhea occurred in sporadic episodes of several weeks duration and affected up to 5% of all animals at any one time. The incidence of the colitis is unknown, but it appeared to be widespread. Histologically, the colitis was similar to that described in cottontop tamarins (Saguinus oedipus oedipus) at the New England Primate Center (1). There was infiltration of predominantly mononuclear cells into the interstitium, dilation of crypts with flattened epithelium, and accumulation of neutrophils and degenerated and necrotic epithelial cells in the lumen (2). The cause of either the diarrhea or the colitis is not known, nor is it known to what extent they are causally related.",
