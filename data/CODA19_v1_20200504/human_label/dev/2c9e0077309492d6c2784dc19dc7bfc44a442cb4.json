      "original_text": "By using the microscopic Markov-chain approximation approach, we investigate the epidemic spreading and the responsive immunization in social networks. It is assumed that individual vaccination behavior depends on the local information of an epidemic. Our results suggest that the responsive immunization has negligible impact on the epidemic threshold and the critical value of initial epidemic outbreak, but it can effectively inhibit the outbreak of epidemic. We also analyze the influence of the intervention on the disease dynamics, where the vaccination is available only to those individuals whose number of neighbors is greater than a certain value. Simulation analysis implies that the intervention strategy can effectively reduce the vaccine use under the epidemic control. V C 2014 AIP Publishing LLC. [http://dx.",

When the voluntary vaccination can eradicate the epidemic transmission eventually, two relevant problems are presented: (i) whether it is able to decrease the possibility of epidemic outbreak? (ii) how the vaccine should be used at minimum to yield better result? In this work, we attempt to solve them to some extent. By introducing the responsive immunization based on the local information, we study the impact of the voluntary vaccination on the epidemic threshold. Theoretical analysis and simulation shows that the responsive immunization cannot significantly affect the condition of epidemic. We further analyze the intervention strategy based on the targeted immunization and find that it can effectively reduce the vaccine use. These results may allow to gain new insight into the role of the voluntary vaccination in the epidemic control.",
