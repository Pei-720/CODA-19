Traditional approaches to mathematical modelling of infectious diseases deal most effectively with large outbreaks in large populations. The desire to elucidate the highly variable dynamics of disease spread amongst small numbers of individuals has fuelled the development of models that depend more directly on surveillance and contact-tracing data. This signals a move towards a closer interplay between epidemiological modelling, surveillance and disease-management strategies. DETERMINISTIC A process that does not contain an element of chance. Deterministic models are often used to describe the progress of an epidemic through large populations, in which small fluctuations at the individual level are assumed not to have an important effect on the dynamics.",
