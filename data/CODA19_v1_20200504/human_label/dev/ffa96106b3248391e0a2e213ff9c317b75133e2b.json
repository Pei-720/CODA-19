Columbids are used for food, hobby, sport (racing homers), entertainment (rollers), display (exotic doves), shows and competitive exhibition (fancy breeds), research and communication (racing homers, tumblers and high fliers). All domestic pigeon breeds are derived from the common rock dove (Columba livia), and there are now more than 800 varieties. Common domesticated doves include the diamond dove (Geopelia cuneata) and European ringneck dove (Streptopelia risoria).",
