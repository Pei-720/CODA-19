      "original_text": "In vitro interferon production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 50 children suffering from recurrent upper respiratory tract infections was examined, and compared with that of 50 healthy children. Five respiratory pathogenic viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were used as inducers. Cells from every child responded to at least three out of the six inducers by interferon production. As a group, cultures prepared from patient cells showed decreased production of IFN when stimulated with adeno, rhino, corona or RS viruses or with the mycoplasma. Similar trend between the two groups of children was seen as regards influenza A virus-induced IFN production in leukocyte cultures. These results corroborate our previous findings that relative deficiency in interferon production appears to be inducer-specific, and suggest that this phenomenon may have a role in the pathogenesis of recurrent respiratory infections.",
