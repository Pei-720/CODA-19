The synthesized scaffolds were evaluated for their in vitro activity against the veterinary protozoal pathogen Tritrichomonas foetus and cytotoxicity against human prostate (PC-3) cancer cell line. The preliminary evaluation data revealed the enhancement in the activity profiles with the introduction of 7chloroquinoline ring with the most active conjugates 7a, 7c and 7d exhibiting an IC 50 of 22.2, 11.3 and 24.5 mM respectively against T. foetus and minimal toxicity against human prostate (PC-3) cell lines.",
