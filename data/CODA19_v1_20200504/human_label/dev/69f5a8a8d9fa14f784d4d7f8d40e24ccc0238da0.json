As ART specialists we should be cautious, carefully monitoring the situation whilst contributing by sharing novel evidence to counsel our patients, both pregnant women and would-be mothers. Time to egg collection and drop-out rates are parameters critical to scheduling treatments once the curve of infections has peaked and plateaued in each country. In order to reduce both parameters, infertile patients now require even more support from their IVF team: urgent oocyte collection for oncologic patients must be guaranteed, and oocyte retrievals for women of advanced maternal age and/or reduced ovarian reserve cannot be postponed indefinitely. This document represents the position of the Italian Society of Fertility and Sterility and Reproductive Medicine (SIFES-MR) in outlining ART priorities during and after this emergency.",
