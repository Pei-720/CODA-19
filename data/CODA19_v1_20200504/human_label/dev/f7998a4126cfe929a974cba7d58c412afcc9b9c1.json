      "original_text": "The etiology of multiple sclerosis (MS) remains elusive. However, clues to its pathogenesis have traditionally been derived from the basic pathologic characterization of central nervous system (CNS) tissues of MS patients. While ongoing debate lingers over the autoimmune nature of MS, it is well established that the immune system directly participates in the destruction of myelin and nervous cells. Understanding the mechanisms of immunemediated destruction of CNS components in MS promises to not only promote effective design of MS therapeutics, but also provides a broader understanding of immune-mediated diseases affecting the CNS. This review will explore the principle features of the immuno-pathology of MS, in particular of relapsing-remitting MS (RR-MS). Herein, emerging concepts in the pathogenesis of MS in the context of known features of pathology have been highlighted. These include the characterization of cytokine networks promoting inflammatory damage of the CNS, B cell involvement, and inflammatory damage of axons and neurons. An effort has been made to preferentially focus on MS rather than animal models of the disease, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). For a more comprehensive examination of data derived from studies on animal models, readers are referred to other outstanding reviews 52,53 . From human studies alone, it is clear that the past 5-10 years have been highly productive in advancing the understanding of the pathogenesis of MS. For both the general neurologist and MS specialist, fundamental appreciation of the immunopathology of MS should lead to a broader understanding of the disease course and the emerging MS therapeutics that are now more than ever tailored to the intricacies of the immune system.",
