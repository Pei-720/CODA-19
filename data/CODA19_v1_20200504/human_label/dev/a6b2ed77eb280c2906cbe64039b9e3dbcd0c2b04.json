      "original_text": "Mannose binding lectin (MBL) generally plays a protective role during viral infection, yet MBL-mediated complement activation promotes Ross River virus (RRV)-induced inflammatory tissue destruction, contributing to arthritis and myositis. As MBL binds to carbohydrates, we hypothesized that N-linked glycans on the RRV envelope glycoproteins act as ligands for MBL. Using a panel of RRV mutants lacking the envelope N-linked glycans, we found that MBL deposition onto infected cells was dependent on the E2 glycans. Moreover, the glycandeficient viruses exhibited reduced disease and tissue damage in a mouse model of RRV-induced myositis compared to wild-type RRV, despite similar viral load and inflammatory infiltrates within the skeletal muscle. Instead, the reduced disease induced by glycan-deficient viruses was linked to decreased MBL deposition and complement activation within inflamed tissues. These results demonstrate that the viral N-linked glycans promote MBL deposition and complement activation onto RRV-infected cells, contributing to the development of RRV-induced myositis.",
