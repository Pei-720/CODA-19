      "original_text": "Background: Seasonal variation has been observed for various bacterial and viral infections. We aimed to further study seasonality of respiratory viruses and bacterial pathogens in relation to antibiotic use, as well as meteorological parameters. Methods: An ecologic study of antibiotic exposure, meteorological parameters, detection of respiratory viruses and clinical isolates of Clostridioides difficile, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (grouped together as gram-negative bacteria; GNB) in Rhode Island from 2012 to 2016. Results: Peak detection of C. difficile occurred 3 months after the peak in antibiotic prescriptions filled (OR \u003d 1.24, 95% CI, 1.07-1.43; P \u003d 0.006). Peak MRSA detection was noted 7 months after the peak in antibiotic prescriptions filled (OR \u003d 1.69, 95% CI, 1.21-2.35; P \u003d 0.003) and 10 months after the peak in respiratory virus detection (OR \u003d 1.04, 95% CI, 1.01-1.06; P \u003d 0.003). Peak GNB detection was noted 2 months after the peak mean monthly ambient temperature (OR \u003d 1.69, 95% C.I., 1.20-2.39; P \u003d 0.004). Peak detection of S. pneumoniae was noted at the same time as the peak in detection of respiratory viruses (OR \u003d 1.01, 95% C.I., 1.00-1.01; P \u003d 0.015). Conclusions: We identified distinct seasonal variation in detection of respiratory viruses and bacterial pathogens. C. difficile seasonality may, in part, be related to antibiotic prescriptions filled; GNB seasonality may be related to ambient temperature and S. pneumoniae may be related to concurrent respiratory viral infections.",
