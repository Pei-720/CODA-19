      "original_text": "For over a decade, phage display has proven to be of immense value, allowing selection of a large variety of genes with novel functions from diverse libraries. However, the folding and modification requirements of complex proteins place a severe constraint on the type of protein that can be successfully displayed using this strategy, a restriction that could be resolved by similarly engineering a eukaryotic virus for display purposes. The quite recently established eukaryotic molecular biology tool, the baculovirus display vector system (BDVS), allows combination of genotype with phenotype and thereby enables presentation of eukaryotic proteins on the viral envelope or capsid. Data have shown that the baculovirus, Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV), is a versatile tool for eukaryotic virus display. Insertion of heterologous peptides and/or proteins into the viral surface by utilizing the major envelope glycoprotein gp64, or foreign membrane-derived counterparts, allows incorporation of the sequence of interest onto the surface of infected cells and virus particles. A number of strategies are being investigated in order to further develop the display capabilities of AcMNPV and improve the complexity of a library that may be accommodated. Numerous expression vectors for various approaches of surface display have already been developed. Further improvement of both insertion and selection strategies toward development of a refined tool for 91 ADVANCES IN VIRUS RESEARCH, VOL 68 use in the creation of useful eukaryotic libraries is, however, needed. Here, the status of baculovirus display with respect to alteration of virus tropism, antigen presentation, transgene expression in mammalian cells, and development of eukaryotic libraries will be reviewed.",
