      "original_text": "Highlights d SARS-CoV small viral RNAs (svRNA) were identified in infected lungs and cell culture d SARS-CoV svRNAs biogenesis was RNase III, cell type, and species independent d svRNA-N repressed the expression of mRNAs with 3 0 UTR specific target sequences d svRNA-N inhibition in vivo reduced lung pathology and proinflammatory cytokines SUMMARY Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) causes lethal disease in humans, which is characterized by exacerbated inflammatory response and extensive lung pathology. To address the relevance of small non-coding RNAs in SARS-CoV pathology, we deep sequenced RNAs from the lungs of infected mice and discovered three 18-22 nt small viral RNAs (svRNAs). The three svRNAs were derived from the nsp3 (svRNA-nsp3.1 and -nsp3.2) and N (svRNA-N) genomic regions of SARS-CoV. Biogenesis of CoV svRNAs was RNase III, cell type, and host species independent, but it was dependent on the extent of viral replication. Antagomir-mediated inhibition of svRNA-N significantly reduced in vivo lung pathology and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Taken together, these data indicate that svRNAs contribute to SARS-CoV pathogenesis and highlight the potential of svRNA-N antagomirs as antivirals.",
