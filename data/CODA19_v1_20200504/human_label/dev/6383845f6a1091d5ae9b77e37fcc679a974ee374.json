In this study, we have confirmed the SARS 6 protein expression in lung and intestine tissues of the SARS patients and in SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells by immunohistochemistry. Further studies by immunoblot and confocal microscopy analyses revealed the expression and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localization of the recombinant SARS 6 protein in mammalian cells. Expression of SARS 6 protein in mammalian cells elicits biological activity of stimulating cellular DNA synthesis.",
