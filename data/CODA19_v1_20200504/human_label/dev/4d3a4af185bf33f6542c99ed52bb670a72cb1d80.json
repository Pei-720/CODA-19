For 63% of adult recipients of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) with a respiratory illness, these viruses have been detected by the use of PCR [1]. Influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, and parainfluenza virus (PIV) are the most common pathogens, and the mortality rate for viral pneumonitis is high [1] . Of the 4 serotypes of PIV, type 3 (PIV3) accounts for 90% of cases [2], with an overall incidence of 5%-7% [3]. Most cases of PIV3 infection among HSCT recipients have occurred during the spring and summer months, when PIV3 infection peaks in the community [4] , and nosocomial outbreaks have been described elsewhere [5] . Pneumonia has been reported in 24%-50% of cases, with a 35% acute mortality rate [3] and a 75% mortality",
