      "original_text": "Despite consistent efforts to protect public health there is still a heavy burden of viral disease, both in the United States and abroad. In addition to conventional medical treatment, there is a need for a holistic approach for early detection and prevention of viral outbreaks at a population level. One-Health is a relatively new integrative approach to the solving of global health challenges. A key component to the One-Health approach is the notion that human health, animal health, and environmental health are all innately interrelated. One-Health interventions, initiated by veterinary doctors, have proven to be effective in controlling outbreaks, but thus far the applications focus on zoonotic viruses transmitted from animals to humans. Environmental engineers and environmental scientists hold a critical role in the further development of One-Health approaches that include water-related transport and transmission of human, animal, and zoonotic viruses. In addition to waterborne viruses, the proposed approach is applicable to a wide range of viruses that are found in human excrement since contaminated water-based surveillance systems may be used for early detection of viral disease. This paper proposes a greater One-Health based framework that involves water-related pathways. The first step in the proposed framework is the identification of critical exposure pathways of viruses in the water environment. Identification of critical pathways informs the second and third steps, which include water-based surveillance systems for early detection at a population level and implementation of intervention approaches to block the critical pathways of exposure.",
