The discovery of a coronavirus as the etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the identification of another coronavirus that causes upper respiratory tract diseases in children (HCoV-NL63) emphasized the importance of improving our understanding of these agents. The identification of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cell-surface receptor for both SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63, has opened the field for the development of new treatments and prophylactics. In this review, we describe the discovery of this coronavirus receptor and its interaction with coronaviral surface proteins in light of viral entry processes and host tropism.",
