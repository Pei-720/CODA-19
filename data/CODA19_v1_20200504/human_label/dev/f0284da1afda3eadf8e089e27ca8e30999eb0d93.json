      "original_text": "There is a lack of evidence regarding the preparedness of general practitioners (GPs) to respond to pandemic influenza. A postal questionnaire survey was conducted to explore the self-perceived pandemic preparedness of GPs in the West Midlands, United Kingdom, and to determine differences between urban and non-urban GPs. The postal questionnaire was sent out to 773 GPs in November 2005, and a reminder was sent in January 2006. In all, 427/773 (55%) questionnaires were returned, and 56% of respondents were aware of influenza pandemic preparedness plans. Approximately one-quarter of respondents (28%, 114/401) thought the response of their practice to a pandemic event would be very poor/poor. Non-urban GPs were significantly more likely to rate the response of their practice to a pandemic as likely to be poor (OR 3.01, 95%CI 1.03-8.76) and were less likely to be aware of pandemic preparedness plans (OR 0.62, 95%CI 0.39-0.99). Non-urban GPs were also significantly more likely to feel less confident in their ability to explain to their patients what to do and why during an influenza pandemic than GPs based in urban areas (OR 4.68,. GPs rating of the odds of a pandemic affecting the United Kingdom did not differ significantly by geographic location. The results of this paper can be used to inform and influence public health policy and as evidence of a need to provide additional education and training to improve pandemic preparedness among GPs, in particular those in non-urban areas.",
