Here, we analyze adaptation in ~1,300 9 virus-interacting proteins manually curated from a set of 9,900 proteins conserved 10 across mammals. We show that viruses (i) use the more evolutionarily constrained 11 proteins from the cellular functions they hijack and that (ii) despite this high constraint, 12 virus-interacting proteins account for a high proportion of all protein adaptation in 13 humans and other mammals. Adaptation is elevated in virus-interacting proteins across 14 all functional categories, including both immune and non-immune functions. Our results 15 demonstrate that viruses are one of the most dominant drivers of evolutionary change 16 across mammalian and human proteomes.",
