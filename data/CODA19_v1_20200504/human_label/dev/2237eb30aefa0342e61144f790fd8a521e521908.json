Although small mammals, experimentally, have a similar autonomic response to dogs during induced hemorrhage and shock states, this response is not noted in the clinical setting, in which decompensated shock is more commonly reported. Poor perfusion affects every major organ system, but particular attention should be given to the immune system, coagulation system, cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal tract, and kidneys. Knowing how these systems are affected helps explain to clinicians why patients with shock can later become septic or coagulopathic.",
