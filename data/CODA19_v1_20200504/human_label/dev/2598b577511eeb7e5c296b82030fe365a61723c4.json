      "original_text": "The diurnal trends of gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters in four Lycoris species (L. houdyshelii, L. aurea, L. radiata var. pumila and L. albiflora) were determined and compared with a portable photosynthesis analysis system. Our study revealed that L. houdyshelii had the lowest light compensation point (LCP), while the other three species had higher LCP (12.37-14.99 μmol m -2 s -1 ); L. aurea had the highest light saturation point (LSP) (1,189 μmol m -2 s -1 ), and L. houdyshelii and L. albiflora had lower LSP with the values being 322 and 345 μmol m -2 s -1 , respectively, and L. radiata var. pumila showed the intermediate LSP. Both the species L. houdyshelii and L. albiflora exhibited a typical and obvious decline in net photosynthetic rate (P N ) during midday, which was not observed in L. aurea. This indicated a possible photoinhibition in L. houdyshelii and L. albiflora as the ratio of variable to maximum fluorescence (F v /F m ) values were higher in these two species. The minimal fluorescence (F 0 ) values were lower in L. aurea and L. radiata var. pumila. The diurnal changes of transpiration rate (E) in all four species presented only one peak, appearing between 11:00 h or 13:00 h. By using simple correlation analyses, it was observed that the environmental factors affecting P N were different among four species and the main factors were photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) and relative humidity especially for L. aurea and L. radiata. The results of studying indicated that the four species could be divided into two groups. The species L. radiata var. pumila and L. aurea were more adapted to a relatively high irradiance, and L. houdyshelii and L. albiflora could be grown in moderate-shade environment in order to scale up their growth and productivity.
