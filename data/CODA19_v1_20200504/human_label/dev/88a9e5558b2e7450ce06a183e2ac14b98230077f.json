      "original_text": "Extracellular proteases are crucial regulators of cell function. The family of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) has classically been described in the context of extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling, which occurs throughout life in diverse processes that range from tissue morphogenesis to wound healing. Recent evidence has implicated MMPs in the regulation of other functions, including survival, angiogenesis, inflammation and signalling. There are at least 25 members of the MMP family and, collectively, these proteases can degrade all constituents of the ECM. As a result of their potent proteolytic activity, abnormal MMP function can also lead to pathological conditions. The most widely studied disease that involves MMPs is cancer metastasis. In this case, the tumour cell is thought to use MMPs to overcome multiple structural barriers and establish a new focus of growth at a distant site from the primary tumour mass. In the nervous system, MMPs have also been associated with pathogenesis, particularly in multiple sclerosis (MS) and malignant gliomas 1 . A growing literature has linked MMPs to stroke, to Alzheimer\u0027s disease and to viral infections of the central nervous system (CNS). The goal of this review is to acquaint the reader with the biology of MMPs, particularly the functions of MMPs that are not associated with matrix turnover. We will highlight the roles of MMPs in pathology of the nervous system, and emphasize the fact that MMPs can also have physiological functions during CNS repair and ontogeny. Last, we will discuss the function of another group of metalloproteinases -ADAMs (a DISINTEGRIN and metalloproteinase) -in CNS pathophysiology, as these proteins might be responsible for many of the activities previously ascribed to MMPs.",

Most ADAMs have a prodomain, a metalloprotease region, a disintegrin domain for adhesion, a cysteine-rich region, epidermal-growth-factor (EGF) repeats, a transmembrane module and a cytoplasmic tail (FIG. 1) . So, ADAMs are unique among cell-surface proteins in having both adhesive and proteolytic activities. The cysteine-rich region and EGF repeats are thought to mediate cell fusion or the interaction of ADAMs with other molecules such as chaperone proteins. The cytoplasmic tails of ADAM9 and -12 interact with protein kinase C and with src, respectively, implicating some ADAM family members as signalling molecules 5,6 . Although most ADAMs are transmembrane proteins, some members (for example, ADAM11, -12, -17 and -28) also have alternatively spliced forms that diverge before the transmembrane module to generate a soluble, secreted protein. It is important to note that only about half of the ADAM family members have a metalloproteinase domain that contains the catalyticsite consensus sequence, indicating that, in ADAMs domains (FIG. 1) : an amino-terminal propeptide region, an amino-terminal catalytic domain (which contains the zinc-binding motif) and a carboxy-terminal domain, which has a high level of similarity to members of the HEMOPEXIN family and is involved in ECM substrate binding for many MMPs. The carboxy-terminal hemopexinlike domain is a four-bladed β-propeller structure that is present in all MMPs except MMP7 and MMP26 (matrilysin and matrilysin-2). A hinge region, which is short in collagenases and long in other MMPs, connects the carboxy-and amino-terminal domains. A short signal sequence (\u0027pre-domain\u0027) lies at the amino-terminal end of the protein, before the propeptide region, and is clipped off as newly synthesized MMPs travel to the cell surface. Last, unlike other MMP groups, the six MT-MMPs are membrane proteins. MT4-MMP (MMP17) and MT6-MMP (MMP25) are glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored MMPs (REF. 3), whereas the other MT-MMPs are transmembrane proteins.",
