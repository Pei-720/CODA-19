Structure based virtual screening of 308 307 chemical compounds was performed using the computation tool Autodock 3.0.5 on a WISDOM Production Environment.

Fifty-three compounds from 35 main groups were tested in an in vitro assay for inhibition of 3CL pro expressed by Escherichia coli. Seven of the 53 compounds were selected; their IC 50 ranged from 38.57 ± 2.41 to 101.38 ± 3.27 lM. Two strong 3CL pro inhibitors were further identified as competitive inhibitors of 3CL pro with K i values of 9.11 ± 1.6 and 9.93 ± 0.44 lM.

A 3-Dimensional coordinate in the X-ray crystal structure of 3CL pro (PDB accession code 2ZU5) 13 obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB; http:// www.pdb.org) 14 was used as the receptor model in the SBVS with docking simulations.
