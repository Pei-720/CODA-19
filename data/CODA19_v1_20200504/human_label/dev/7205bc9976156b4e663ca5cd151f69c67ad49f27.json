      "original_text": "Background: As the number of patients with Zika virus infection increases worldwide, nursing students who conduct clinical practice in hospitals tend to at risk of Zika virus infection. Therefore, this study was conducted to identify nursing students\u0027 knowledge, attitudes, practices, and risk perceptions of infection prevention related to occupational exposure to Zika virus infection, and to identify correlations among the related variables. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 249 nursing students from 3 nursing colleges located in 3 Korean cities, with experience in hospital clinical practice. A questionnaire to assess the knowledge, attitudes, practices, and risk perceptions of Zika virus infection was developed through a literature review and was subjected to pilot testing and validation. Results: The level of infection-control knowledge for Zika virus was 54.5 of 100 points, and that of practice was 4.5 of 5 points. The infection-prevention attitude score was 4.4 of 5 points, and the risk-perception score was 2.3 of 5 points. Significant differences emerged in infection-prevention attitude toward Zika virus based on Zika virus vaccination intention. Additionally, practice and risk-perception scores differed significantly based on gender and Zika virus vaccination intention. Knowledge significantly correlated with attitude and attitude toward preventive behavior. Conclusion: Improvement in infection-control knowledge for Zika virus can help improve nurses\u0027 related attitudes, which in turn could promote effective practice. Considering the characteristics of nursing students, it is necessary to develop and apply an effective and viable education program related to the prevention of Zika virus infection.",
