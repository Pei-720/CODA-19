In practice, there are restrictions associated with limited vaccination coverage and the maximum daily vaccine administration. We extend previous work on optimal control for influenza to reflect these realistic restrictions using mixed constraints on state and control variables. An optimal control problem is formulated with the aim of minimizing the number of infected individuals while considering intervention costs. Time-dependent vaccination is computed and analysed using a model incorporating heterogeneity in population structure under different settings of transmissibility levels, vaccine coverages, and time delays.",
