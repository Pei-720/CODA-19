      "original_text": "Despite improvements over the past several decades, infection remains a significant risk to all haematological patients receiving therapy. Those requiring allogeneic transplant and especially those that have HLA disparity or T-cell-depleted grafts have an even higher risk of infective complications due to delayed recovery of T-and B-cell function. Early identification with prompt effective treatment is paramount to improve all patients\u0027 survival. Patient safety through robust adherence to hand hygiene and maintenance of the environment with cleaning and disinfection are the backbone of an effective preventative program. Basic nursing care and a sound knowledge base of the risks, presentation, diagnosis and treatment will improve patient care.",
