      "original_text": "The influence of locked nucleic acid (LNA) residues on the thermodynamic properties of 2 0 -O-methyl RNA/RNA heteroduplexes is reported. Optical melting studies indicate that LNA incorporated into an otherwise 2 0 -O-methyl RNA oligonucleotide usually, but not always, enhances the stabilities of complementary duplexes formed with RNA. Several trends are apparent, including: (i) a 3 0 terminal U LNA and 5 0 terminal LNAs are less stabilizing than interior and other 3 0 terminal LNAs; (ii) most of the stability enhancement is achieved when LNA nucleotides are separated by at least one 2 0 -O-methyl nucleotide; and (iii) the effects of LNA substitutions are approximately additive when the LNA nucleotides are separated by at least one 2 0 -O-methyl nucleotide. An equation is proposed to approximate the stabilities of complementary duplexes formed with RNA when at least one 2 0 -O-methyl nucleotide separates LNA nucleotides. The sequence dependence of 2 0 -Omethyl RNA/RNA duplexes appears to be similar to that of RNA/RNA duplexes, and preliminary nearestneighbor free energy increments at 37 C are presented for 2 0 -O-methyl RNA/RNA duplexes. Internal mismatches with LNA nucleotides significantly destabilize duplexes with RNA.",
