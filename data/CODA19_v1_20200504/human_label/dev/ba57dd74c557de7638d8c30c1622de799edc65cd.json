We propose a minimum dataset to capture data needed to examine the basic reproduction rate, case status and criteria, symptoms, and outcomes of SARS. F irst detected in China, confirmed and probable cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have now appeared in at least 30 countries in five continents. SARS is the first new severe infectious disease to occur in the 21st century, and little is known about its epidemiologic features (1). To assess the effect of SARS on public health and outcomes, data are needed about who becomes ill, how they contracted their illness, and the sequelae.",
