      "original_text": "Objective:To explore the epidemiology and etiology for an outbreak of acute respiratory tract infection that occurred in one county of Jiangsu Province, China 2004. Methods: Only cases meeting the case definition were included in the study. We reviewed the medical records of the cases who were admitted to the local hospitals, interviewed cases by a standard questionnaire, and then described the epidemiologic features and analyzed risk factors by means of a case-control study. We collected pharyngeal swab specimens and sent them to different laboratories for isolation and culture. The laboratory used different detection methods such as DIF, PCR, electron microscope examination and microneutralization assay, to identify and then type the positive specimens. Results:A total of 871 cases were reported during the period from April 18 to July 4, 2004. The distribution of onset times presented two peaks, one in late May and another in middle June. The epidemic occurred mainly in the elementary and junior high schools in ten townships of one county, and the mean age of the cases was 12 years (range 7 months to 18 years). The course of the disease was acute, and was characterized by fever accompanied with sore throat and tonsillitis. The WBC count of cases was normal or elevated. The mean duration of illness was 5 days (range 2 to 12 days). No fatalities from illness were reported. A case-control study indicated that the possible risk factors were close contact with a case and/or poultry before onset and sharing of towels among members of the family. The typical CPE was observed through inoculating pharyngeal swab specimens into the HEP-2 cell cultures in different laboratories. An infection of adenovirus type 3 was verified by detecting positive specimens in different methods. Conclusion:This investigation demonstrated that the acute respiratory infection in cases was caused by adenovirus type 3. Cases occurred in over 70 schools in ten townships in 2004, and the route of transmission was possibly close contact with cases or droplet transmission.",
