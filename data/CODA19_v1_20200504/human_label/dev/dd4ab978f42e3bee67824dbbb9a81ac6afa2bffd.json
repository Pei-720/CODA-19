      "original_text": "Twelve healthy female ferrets were anesthetized and underwent combined PET/CT scanning. After the images were fused, volumes of interest (VOIs) were generated in the liver, heart, thymus, and bilateral lung fields. For each VOI, standardized uptake values (SUVs) were calculated. Additional comparisons were made between radiotracer uptake periods (60, 90, and \u003e90 minutes), intravenous and intraperitoneal injections of F-FDG, and respiratory gated and ungated acquisitions. Pulmonary structures and the surrounding thoracic and upper abdominal anatomy were readily identified on the CT scans of all ferrets and were successfully fused with PET. VOIs were created in various tissues with the following SUV calculations: heart (maximum standardized uptake value [SUV ] 8.60, mean standardized uptake value [SUV ] 5.42), thymus (SUV 3.86, SUV 2.59), liver (SUV 1.37, SUV 0.99), right lung (SUV 0.92, SUV 0.56), and left lung (SUV 0.88, SUV 0.51). Sixty-to 90-minute uptake periods were sufficient to separate tissues based on background SUV activity. No gross differences in image quality were seen between intraperitoneal and intravenous injections of F-FDG. Respiratory gating also did not have a significant impact on image quality of lung parenchyma. The authors concluded that F-FDG PET and CT imaging can be performed successfully in normal healthy ferrets with the parameters identified in this study. They obtained similar imaging features and uptake measurements with and without th 18 18 Max Mean 18 18 18 18 Max Mean Max Mean Max Mean Max Mean Max Mean 18 18",
