      "original_text": "ClinMicroNet is a closed Internet discussion group, where doctoral-level clinical and public health microbiologists from many countries share their knowledge and experience. This collaborative approach to resolving issues and questions in the field of clinical microbiology transcends organizational, institutional, state and national boundaries. Based upon observations of list communications during 10 weeks and a small group user su~y, this study analyzed the nature of communications and member\u0027s perceptions of the network. An explicit-tacit knowledge quadrant identifies distinct ways in which knowledge is transferred and created. Empirical evidence shows that ClinMicroNet complements other resources by encouraging members to share experiences and collaborate in establishing the best practices. Driven by a core group of active members, the network is highly participative and strongly supported. In turn, members maintain professional relationships beyond the list, which reinforces the network and its members\u0027 capacity to confront new threats and challenges in clinical microbiology.",
