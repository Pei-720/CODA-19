Methods: A case of Aspergillus meningitis is described. A comprehensive review of the Englishlanguage literature was conducted to identify all reported cases of Aspergillus meningitis described between January 1973 and December 2011. Results: Ninety-three cases (including the one described herein) of Aspergillus meningitis were identified. Fifty-two (55.9%) were in individuals without any predisposing factor or known causes of immunosuppression. Acute and chronic meningitis was diagnosed in 65.6% of patients and meningoencephalitis in 24.7% of them with the remaining presenting with spinal arachnoiditis and ventriculitis. Cerebrospinal fluid cultures for Aspergillus spp. were positive in about 31% of cases and the galactomannan antigen test in 87%. Diagnosis during life was achieved in 52 patients (55.9%) with a case fatality rate of 50%. The overall case fatality rate was 72.1%.",
