      "original_text": "Purification of turkey coronavirus (TCoV) nucleocapsid (N) protein, expressed in a prokaryotic expression system as histidine-tagged fusion protein is demonstrated in the present study. Turkey coronavirus was partially purified from infected intestine of turkey embryo by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation and RNA was extracted. The N protein gene was amplified from the extracted RNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and cloned. The recombinant expression construct (pTri-N) was identified by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing analysis. Expression of histidine-tagged fusion N protein with a molecular mass of 57 kd was determined by Western blotting analysis. By chromatography on nickel-agarose column, the expressed N protein was purified to near homogeneity as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. The protein recovery could be 2.5 mg from 100 ml of bacterial culture. The purified N protein was recognized by antibody to TCoV in Western blotting assay. The capability of the recombinant N protein to differentiate positive serum of turkey infected with TCoV from normal turkey serum was evident in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). These results indicated that the expressed N protein is a superior source of TCoV antigen for development of antibody-capture ELISA for detection of antibodies to TCoV.",
