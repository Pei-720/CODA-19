Methods: A national sample of 427 Taiwanese male adults aged at least 45 years (mean (M) \u003d 57) were recruited to complete a telephone-based survey questionnaire between April 30 and May 8, 2008. Results: The questionnaire results showed that respondents considered themselves less likely than others to get prostate cancer. The relationship between optimistic bias and intention to undergo prostate cancer screening was non-significant, while information seeking positively and significantly predicted such an intention. Conclusions: The findings of this study imply that health educators should include risk-awareness strategies and information seeking interventions in the design of cancer prevention programs.",
