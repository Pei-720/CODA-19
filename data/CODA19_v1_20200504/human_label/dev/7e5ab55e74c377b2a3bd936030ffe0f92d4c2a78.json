      "original_text": "Candida auris is an emerging multidrug-resistant fungal pathogen. Since first reported in 2009, C. auris has caused healthcare outbreaks around the world, often involving high mortality. Identification of C. auris has been a major challenge as many common conventional laboratory methods cannot accurately detect it. Early detection and implementation of infection control practices can prevent its spread. The aim of this review is to describe recommendations for the detection and control of C. auris in healthcare settings. most common misidentifications based on frequently used yeast identification methods [5, 6] . However, efforts to improve C. auris identification methods have made substantial progress in the last few years. The development of a high-salt, high-temperature enrichment culture-based method has made it possible to reliably isolate C. auris from complex sample types [7] [8] [9] . Once an isolate is obtained, identification of C. auris can be efficiently accomplished with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. For MALDI-TOF identification, it is important to ensure C. auris is in the reference database [5, 6, 10] . The Bruker Biotyper (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany) and the VITEK MS (bioMérieux, Marcy, L\u0027Etoile, France) include C. auris in their Research Use Only and certain versions of their FDA-approved system databases [3, 5, 11] . If MALDI-TOF is not available, laboratories can reliably identify an isolate by sequencing the D1-D2 region of the 28s rDNA or the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of rDNA [12] [13] [14] .",
