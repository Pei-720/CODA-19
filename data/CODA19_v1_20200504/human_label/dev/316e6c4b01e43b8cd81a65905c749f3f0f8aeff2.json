However, habitat loss, hunting and the continued presence of humans have a negative effect on the biology and behaviour of almost all nonhuman primates. Noninvasive methods such as stool collection are among the safest alternative ways to study the multiple aspects of the biology of primates. Many epidemiologic issues (e.g. pathogen detection, microbiota studies) may be easily studied using stool samples from primates. Primates are undoubtedly among the first candidates suspected of becoming the source of one of the next emerging epidemic of zoonotic origin, as has already been observed with HIV, malaria and monkeypox.
