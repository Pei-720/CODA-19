The capture ELISAs showed higher sensitivity than indirect ELISAs for detection of BCV-speci®c IgA and IgM. In the capture ELISAs the agreement between detection in milk and serum samples was 94% for IgA and 86% for IgM. The correlation between log 10 titres in milk and serum was r0.82 (P\u003c0.001) for IgA and 0.84 (P\u003c0.001) for IgM. Milk seemed a better target than serum for diagnosing speci®c IgA at low levels. There was no variation in the isotype-speci®c BCV antibody titres between healthy quarters of the same udder, but subclinical mastitis was associated with higher levels of IgA antibodies and weak false IgM positive reactions in undiluted milk. Bovine IgA and IgM antibodies in milk and serum showed high stability towards freezing and thawing and storage at room temperature.",

IgM was also detected in the reinfected cows, but mostly at lower levels and for a shorter period of time than in the primarily infected animals. In milk, however, the IgM response of the reinfected cows was detected for a longer period of time than in serum. Six months after the outbreak, IgA was still detected in both serum and milk of all six cows and also in serum of one calf. The reinfected cows showed higher and more long-lasting peak levels of IgA in milk and serum than the primarily infected cows, indicating boosting of the IgA response. #",
