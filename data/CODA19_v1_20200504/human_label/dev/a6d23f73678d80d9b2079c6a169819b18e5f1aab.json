However, recent studies have uncovered additional roles for CD4 + T cells, some of which are independent of other lymphocytes, and have described previously unappreciated functions for memory CD4 + T cells in immunity to viruses. Here, we review the full range of antiviral functions of CD4 + T cells, discussing the activities of these cells in helping other lymphocytes and in inducing innate immune responses, as well as their direct antiviral roles. We suggest that all of these functions of CD4 + T cells are integrated to provide highly effective immune protection against viral pathogens.",
