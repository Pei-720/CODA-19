CD4 + T lymphocyte levels were reduced in 100% of patients, CD8 + T lymphocyte levels were reduced in 87%, B lymphocyte levels were reduced in 76%, and natural killer cell levels were reduced in 55%. Our data suggested that these patients\u0027 immune systems were impaired during the course of SARS.
