      "original_text": "A key challenge for estimating the epidemiological parameters of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan is the discrepancy between the officially reported number of infections and the true number of infections. A common approach to tackling the challenge is to use the number of infections exported from Wuhan to infer the true number in the city. This approach can only provide a static estimate of the epidemiological parameters before Wuhan lockdown on January 23, 2020, because there are almost no exported cases thereafter. Here, we propose a method to dynamically estimate the epidemiological parameters of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan by recovering true numbers of infections from day-to-day official numbers. Using the method, we provide a comprehensive retrospection on how the disease had progressed in Wuhan from January 19 to March 5, 2020. Particularly, we estimate that the outbreak sizes by January 23 and March 5 were 11,239 [95% CI 10,852-11,541] and 124,506 [95% CI 96,703-155,317], respectively. The effective reproduction number attained its maximum on January 24 (3.42 [95% CI 3.21-3.54]) and became less than 1 from February 7 (0.76 [95% CI 0.66-0.87]). We also estimate the effects of two major government interventions on the spread of COVID-19 in Wuhan.",
