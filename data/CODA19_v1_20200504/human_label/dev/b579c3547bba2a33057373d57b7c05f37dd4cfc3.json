      "original_text": "BACKGROUND: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-infected pneumonia (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China. Travel-associated cases have also been reported in other countries. The number of cases has increased rapidly but laboratory diagnosis is limited. METHODS: We collect two groups of cases diagnosed with COVID-19 for experiments. One group collected 63 samples for Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) IgG and IgM antibodies. The other group collected 91 plasma samples for colloidal gold-immunochromatographic assay (GICA). RESULTS: The sensitivity of the combined ELISA IgM and ELISA IgG detection was 55/63 ( 87.3%), The sensitivity of the combined GICA IgM and GICA IgG detection was 75/91 ( 82.4%), Both methods are negative for healthy controls, specificity of 100% .There is no significant difference between the sensitivity of between ELISA and GICA (IgM+ IgG). CONCLUSIONS: ELISA and GICA for specific IgM and IgG antibodies are conventional serological assays, they are simple, fast, and safe, the results can be used for clinical reference, and the huge clinical diagnosis and treatment pressure can be .The disease has rapidly spread from Wuhan to other areas. By February 27, 2020, there were 78630 confirmed cases reported in China, and tragically we have now surpassed 2747 people in China have lost their lives because of this virus. Most of the cases and most of the deaths are in Hubei province, Wuhan. Outside China, there are 3545 cases in 40 countries, and 35 death. The type of pneumonia caused by the 2019 All rights reserved.
