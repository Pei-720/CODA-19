      "original_text": "Enabling innovation and access to health technologies remains a key strategy in combating infectious diseases in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, a gulf between paying markets and the endemicity of such diseases has contributed to the dearth of R\u0026D in meeting these public health needs. While the pharmaceutical industry views emerging economies as potential new markets, most of the world\u0027s poorest bottom billion now reside in middle-income countries-a fact that has complicated tiered access arrangements. However, product development partnerships-particularly those involving academic institutions and small firms-find commercial opportunities in pursuing even neglected diseases; and a growing pharmaceutical sector in BRICS countries offers hope for an indigenous base of innovation. Such innovation will be shaped by 1) access to building blocks of knowledge; 2) strategic use of intellectual property and innovative financing to meet public health goals; 3) collaborative norms of open innovation; and 4) alternative business models, some with a double bottom line. Facing such resource constraints, LMICs are poised to develop a new, more resource-effective model of innovation that holds exciting promise in meeting the needs of global health.",
