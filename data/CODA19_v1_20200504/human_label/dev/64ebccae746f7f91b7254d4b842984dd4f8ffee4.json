L-SIGN, encoded by CLEC4M (also known as CD209L), is a SARS-CoV binding receptor that has polymorphism in its extracellular neck region encoded by the tandem repeat domain in exon 4. Our genetic risk association study shows that individuals homozygous for CLEC4M tandem repeats are less susceptible to SARS infection. L-SIGN is expressed in both non-SARS and SARS-CoV-infected lung. Compared with cells heterozygous for L-SIGN, cells homozygous for L-SIGN show higher binding capacity for SARS-CoV, higher proteasome-dependent viral degradation and a lower capacity for trans infection. Thus, homozygosity for L-SIGN plays a protective role during SARS infection.",

Unlike DC-SIGN, which is expressed, for example, on dendritic cells, L-SIGN is expressed in the liver, lymph nodes and placenta 9,10 . The extracellular regions of both CLEC4M and CD209 contain tandem repeats of a highly conserved 23-amino acid sequence, followed by a C-terminal C-type carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) [11] [12] [13] . In contrast to CD209, CLEC4M has considerable polymorphism in the tandem repeat domain of exon 4, which consists of three to nine repeats of a 69-base pair segment, with seven repeats being predominant (450%) in the general population 10 . This tandem repeat segment encodes the extracellular neck region and has been suggested to be important for homo-oligomerization of L-SIGN on the cell surface, which brings the CRDs into proximity for high-affinity ligand binding 10,11 . It has been suggested that heterozygous expression of polymorphic variants of L-SIGN, in which neck lengths differ, may prevent the formation of hetero-oligomers and may thus lead to a reduced ligand-binding affinity 8 .",

Recent data have further demonstrated that L-SIGN can bind SARS-CoV 20 . It has also been shown that individual susceptibility to SARS infection may depend on genetic factors of the host: for example, HLA class I polymorphism 21, 22 . As L-SIGN can bind SARS-CoV and its homo-or heterozygosity may determine the ligand-binding capacity, we hypothesized that CLEC4M homo-or heterozygosity might affect individual susceptibility to SARS infection. We therefore performed a genetic risk association study and a series of in vitro experiments to examine the biological role of L-SIGN in SARS infection.",
