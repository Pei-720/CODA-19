We now demonstrate that SLPI binds to the membrane of human macrophages through the phospholipidbinding protein, annexin II. Based on the recent identification of human cell membrane phosphatidylserine (PS) in the outer coat of HIV-1, we define a novel role for annexin II, a PS-binding moiety, as a cellular cofactor supporting macrophage HIV-1 infection. Moreover, this HIV-1 PS interaction with annexin II can be disrupted by SLPI or other annexin II-specific inhibitors. The PS-annexin II connection may represent a new target to prevent HIV-1 infection.",
