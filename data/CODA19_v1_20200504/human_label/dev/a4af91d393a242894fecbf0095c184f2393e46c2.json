      "original_text": "The emergence of new infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) variants is often disastrous in the poultry industry. In this study, an IBV, CK/CH/2010/JT-1, was isolated from an H120-and 4/91-IBV-vaccinated flock in China. Antisera against vaccine strains H120 and 4/91 could not provide effective protection against CK/CH/2010/JT-1 in virus neutralization assays. CK/CH/2010/JT-1 could cause 43.75% mortality with respiratory and severe renal lesions in inoculated chickens. Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene showed that CK/CH/2010/JT-1 and 31 other isolates could be grouped as a new genotypic cluster. Recombination analysis revealed that three recombination events could be found in the genome of CK/ CH/2010/JT-1 at positions 24709-365, 17160-19811 and 21136-21770. Whole-genome sequence analysis showed that CK/CH/2010/JT-1 originated from multiple template switches among QX-like, CK/CH/LSC/ 99I-, tl/CH/LDT3/03-and 4/91-type IBVs. All of these data demonstrated that CK/CH/2010/JT-1 is a new recombinant genotype IBV with high virulence. Our findings suggest that the surveillance of new genotype strains of IBV is very important for developing more effective anti-IBV strategies.",
