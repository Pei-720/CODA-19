      "original_text": "Monocyte development is a tightly regulated and multi-staged process, occurring through several defined progenitor cell intermediates. The key transcription factors, including PU.1, IRF8 and KLF4, growth factors, such as M-CSF and IL-34 and cytokines that drive monocyte development from hematopoietic progenitor cells are well defined. However, the molecular controls that direct differentiation into the Ly6C hi inflammatory and Ly6C lo monocyte subsets are yet to be completely elucidated. This review will provide a summary of the transcriptional regulation of monocyte development. We will also discuss how these molecular controls are also critical for microglial development despite their distinct haematopoetic origins. Furthermore, we will examine recent breakthroughs in defining mechanisms that promote differentiation of specific monocyte subpopulations.",
