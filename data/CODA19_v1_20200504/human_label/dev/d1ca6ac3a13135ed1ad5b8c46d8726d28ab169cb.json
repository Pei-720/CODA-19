      "original_text": "According to the 2009 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Survey, 5.6% of patients who sought treatment in emergency departments (EDs) were febrile at the time of presentation. Second only to abdominal pain and cramps, fever was the second most common chief complaint for patients who came to EDs that year, and the most common chief complaint of patients younger than 15 years. The presence of fever prompts the question of whether antimicrobials should be administered empirically. The survey data also indicate that antimicrobials were the most prescribed drug category, second only to analgesics. 1 In EDs around the United States, 7% to 8% of visits involve the administration of at least 1 antimicrobial. 2 Antimicrobials are ordered in the ED every day. Sometimes the indication is straightforward and the choices are simple; at other times the decisions are more",
