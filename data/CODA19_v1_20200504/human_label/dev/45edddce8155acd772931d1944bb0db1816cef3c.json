Transmission-based precautions are implemented for those patients who are known or suspected to be infected or colonized with an infectious agent, and therefore require additional control measures to effectively prevent transmission. 3. Transmission-based precautions should be applied empirically based on clinical suspicion and presence of defined disease processes associated with pathogenic organisms, while confirmatory tests are pending. 4. The most common indication for airborne precautions is suspicion for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, or primary or disseminated varicella zoster in an immunocompromised host. 5. The most common indications for droplet precautions are upper respiratory infections concerning for viral causes, or bacterial infections, including Neisseria meningitidis or Haemophilus influenzae.",
