Multiplexed bioanalytical techniques provide control agencies and food industries with new possibilities for improved, more efficient monitoring of food and environmental contaminants. This review deals with recent developments in planar-array and suspension-array technologies, and their applications in detecting pathogens, food allergens and adulterants, toxins, antibiotics and environmental contaminants. ª",
