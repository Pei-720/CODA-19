Subcloning into the vector pGEX-2T and subsequent expression resulted in a 43 kDa fusion protein of ffNF-(Y and glutathione S-transferase (GST). Thrombin cleavage of the fusion protein yielded a 17 kDa protein. This protein cross-reacted with a monoclonal anti-human TNF-(Y antibody in Western blotting, but not with a polyclonal anti-murine TNF-a serum. Recombinant fI\u0027NF-a (rfTNF-cl!) and rfTNF-cr-GST had a CDS, of 15 ng ml-\u0027 and 230 ng ml-\u0027, respectively, in the L929 cytotoxicity assay. Cats given rfTNF-a-GST intravenously manifested the typical biological effects of TNF-(u, including fever, depression, and piloerection. The rfTNF-a-GST upregulated IL-2 receptor and MHC-II antigen expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated in vitro, but had no effect on TNF-o receptor and MHC-I antigen expression. 47-22 9648 18. 0165-2427/95/$09.50 0 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.
