      "original_text": "We have developed a real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) method to detect 13 respiratory viruses: infl uenza virus A and B; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) subgroup A and B; parainfl uenza virus (PIV) 1, 2, and 3; adenovirus; rhinovirus (RV); enterovirus; coronavirus (OC43); human metapneumovirus (hMPV); and human bocavirus (HBoV). The new method for detection of these viruses was applied simultaneously with real-time PCR for the detection of six bacterial pathogens in clinical samples from 1700 pediatric patients with communityacquired pneumonia (CAP). Of all the patients, 32.5% were suspected to have single bacterial infections; 1.9%, multiple bacterial infections; 15.2%, coinfections of bacteria and viruses; 25.8%, single viral infections; and 2.1%, multiple viral infections. In the remaining 22.6%, the etiology was unknown. The breakdown of suspected causative pathogens was as follows: 24.4% were Streptococcus pneumoniae, 14.8% were Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 11.3% were Haemophilus infl uenzae, and 1.4% were Chlamydophila pneumoniae. The breakdown of viruses was as follows: 14.5% were RV, 9.4% were RSV, 7.4% were hMPV, 7.2% were PIV, and 2.9% were HBoV. The new method will contribute to advances in the accuracy of diagnosis and should also result in the appropriate use of antimicrobials.",
