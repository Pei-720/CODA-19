      "original_text": "Respiratory viral infections (RVIs) can be associated with a wide range of clinical manifestations ranging from self-limited upper respiratory tract infections to more devastating conditions, such as pneumonia. RVIs constitute the most frequent reason for medical consultations in the world and they have a considerable impact on quality of life and productivity. Therefore, the prevention and control of RVIs remain major clinical goals. Currently, there are approximately 200 known respiratory viruses that can be grouped into one family of DNA viruses (Adenoviridae) and four families of RNA viruses (Orthomyxoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Picornaviridae and Coronaviridae). In this paper, we review the major respiratory viruses that cause disesases in humans, with an emphasis on current treatment options.",
