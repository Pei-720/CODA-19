In this study, we investigated the seasonality of the total newly notified pulmonary TB cases by subgroups such as time period, sex, age, occupation, district, and sputum smear result from 2004 to 2013 in Wuhan by a popular seasonal adjustment model (TRAMO-SEATS).",

There were no statistical differences for spring seasonal amplitude within subgroups of gender, age, district, and sputum smear result (P.0.05). However, there were significant differences in spring seasonal amplitude by occupation, with amplitude ranging from 59.37% to 113.22% (P,0.05).

There were significant differences in summer seasonal amplitude by age, with amplitude ranging from 36.05% to 100.09% (P,0.05).
