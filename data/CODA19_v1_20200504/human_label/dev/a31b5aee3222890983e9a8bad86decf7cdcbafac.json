Approximately 20% of the participants had IES scores ≥30, indicating the presence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Four areas were classified as more important using factor analysis: health and relationship with the family, relationship with friends/colleagues, work and spiritual. The areas for coping strategies were clear directives/precautionary measures, ability to give feedback to/obtain support from management, support from supervisors/colleagues, support from the family, ability to talk to someone and religious convictions. Support from supervisors/colleagues was a significant negative predictor for psychiatric symptoms and PTSD. Work and clear communication of directives/precautionary measures also helped reduce psychiatric symptoms.",
