      "original_text": "Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) is a glycoprotein and a member of the C-type lectin super family, the collectin family, and the acute phase protein family. The MBL exerts its function by directly binding to microbial surfaces through its carbohydrate recognition domains, followed by direct opsonization or complement activation via MBL-associated serine proteases (MASP) −1 and −2. Thus, MBL plays a major role in the first-line innate defense against pathogens. We investigated the MBL concentrations in serum during experimental infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infections in chickens. The results showed that the acute phase MBL response to infection with IBV was, to a degree (P \u003c 0.0068), dependent on whether the chickens were inoculated after 12 h of rest (dark) or after 12 h of activity (light).
