The SHFV 3 (+) non-coding region (NCR) is 76 nts in length and forms a stem loop (SL) structure that was confirmed by ribonuclease structure probing. Two cell proteins, p56 and p42, bound specifically to a probe consisting of the SHFV 3 (+)NCR RNA. The 3 (+)NCR RNAs of two additional members of the arterivirus genus specifically interacted with two cell proteins of the same size. p56 was identified as polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) and p42 was identified as fructose bisphosphate aldolase A. PTB binding sites were mapped to a terminal loop and to a bulged region of the SHFV 3 SL structure. Deletion of either of the PTB binding sites in the viral RNA significantly reduced PTB binding activity, suggesting that both sites are required for efficient binding of this protein.",
