Overactivation of brain Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) -Angiotensin II (Ang II) -Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT 1 R) axis was found to be involved in the progress of hypertension, atherosclerosis and thrombogenesis, which increased the susceptibility to ischemic stroke. Besides, brain Ang II levels have been revealed to be increased in ischemic tissues after stroke, and contribute to neural damage through elevating oxidative stress levels and inducing inflammatory response in the ischemic hemisphere via AT 1 R.",
