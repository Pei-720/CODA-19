      "original_text": "To investigate the mechanisms of SRSF7 homeostasis, we generated cell lines SRSF7 is an essential RNA-binding protein whose misexpression promotes cancer. Here, we describe how SRSF7 maintains its protein homeostasis in murine P19 cells using an intricate negative feedback mechanism. SRSF7 binding to its premessenger RNA promotes inclusion of a poison cassette exon and transcript degradation via nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). However, elevated SRSF7 levels inhibit NMD and promote translation of two protein halves, termed Split-ORFs, from the bicistronic SRSF7-PCE transcript. The first half acts as dominant-negative isoform suppressing poison cassette exon inclusion and instead promoting the retention of flanking introns containing repeated SRSF7 binding sites. Massive SRSF7 binding to these sites and its oligomerization promote the assembly of large nuclear bodies, which sequester SRSF7 transcripts at their transcription site, preventing their export and restoring normal SRSF7 protein levels. We further show that hundreds of human and mouse NMD targets, especially RNA-binding proteins, encode potential Split-ORFs, some of which are expressed under specific cellular conditions. SRSF7 binding promotes splicing of NMD-sensitive and -resistant SRSF7 isoforms. To understand the mechanism of SRSF7 auto-regulation, we examined the binding of SRSF7 protein to SRSF7 transcripts using individual-nucleotide resolution ultraviolet (UV) crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP). We used normalized significant crosslink events (X-links, false discovery rate (FDR) \u003c 0.05) from SRSF3 and SRSF7 iCLIP datasets of P19 cell lines without OE 8 . Similar to SRSF3, which promotes the inclusion of the PCE in SRSF7 transcripts 17 , SRSF7 showed enriched crosslinks in an extended region encompassing the PCE, its flanking introns 3a and 3b, and exons 3, 4 and 5 (Fig. 1d ). Quantification revealed that SRSF7 binds ~50-fold more to SRSF7 transcripts than SRSF3 (Supplementary Table 1 ), indicating that SRSF7 has an unusual preference for its own transcripts.",

This polypeptide was indeed detectable in SRSF7 OE cells using both anti-GFP and mAb104 antibodies (Extended Data Fig. 2d ,e, pink asterisk). MS/MS analyses after IP confirmed the presence of peptides mapping to the junction between the RS domain and the GFP tag (Extended Data Fig. 2f,g) , although few peptides mapped to the RS domain itself and none to the unique 11-amino acid N terminus. This is likely due to the low abundance of this protein, small peptide sizes and the high charge and repetitive nature of RS domains. The in-frame start codon of SRSF7_RS is ultraconserved in mammals and the same protein halves would also arise from translation of the human SRSF7-PCE isoform (Extended Data Fig. 2h ). Altogether, our data reveal that upon PCE inclusion, the resulting transcript encodes two SRSF7 protein halves (referred to as Split-ORFs).",
