Saudi Arabia, a relatively young economy, has fostered the most enormous growth in this religious pilgrimage history has yet seen, with aggressive and rapid modernization in all aspects of Hajj planning: Hajj facilities, procedures, healthcare and policy making are all comprehensive and on an immense scale. Still, there is no sign of slowing in the growth of pilgrim attendance. As Hajj congregations grow in the order of millions, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia rises to new challenges on colossal scales with relentless drive, challenges that are the focus of this chapter discussion.",
