The literature is limited regarding studies of HCWs\u0027 use of PPE in patient care tasks. Methods: A pilot study was conducted to examine the feasibility of using a simulated health care environment to assess HCWs\u0027 technique when implementing standard airborne and contact isolation precautions. The participants (n 5 10) were assigned patient care tasks based on their specific professional roles. The encounters were digitally recorded during donning and doffing of PPE, as well as during interactions with the simulated patient. Powdered fluorescent marker was used as a measure of contamination.",
