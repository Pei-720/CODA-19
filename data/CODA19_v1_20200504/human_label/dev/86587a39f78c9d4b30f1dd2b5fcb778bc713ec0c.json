Letai et al. investigated this idea using mice that develop leukaemia in which the overexpression of the key antiapoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL2) could be conditionally turned off. Eliminating BCL2 rapidly induces apoptosis and leukaemia remission, providing support for the potential of BCL2 as an anticancer drug target, and suggesting that if apoptotic defects are eliminated, inherent death signals would kill cancer cells.",
