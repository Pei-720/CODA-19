The point releases of both myxoma virus and RHDV into large naive host populations represent a grand experiment in disease emergence and evolution (10), which provides a unique opportunity to study the virulence evolution of emerging pathogens as well as their complex interactions with each other. It is notable that since the release of RHDV in Australia in 1995, strains of 1 viral lineage dominate the viral population nationwide despite hundreds of deliberate rereleases of the original virus strain for local rabbit control, which strongly suggests it has a major selective advantage (7). That RHDV2 appeared in a wild rabbit is therefore remarkable, particularly because Australian field strains were spreading simultaneously in the same area. Comparing the epidemiology of this strain in Australia to the epidemiology of its well-documented spread in Europe will provide valuable insights into RHDV epidemiology relevant to both continents.",
