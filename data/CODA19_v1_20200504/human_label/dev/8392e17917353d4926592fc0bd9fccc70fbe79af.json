We surveyed boarded patients, patients without a disposition, and visitors at a county hospital ED serving a mixed urban and rural population. Subjects were asked \"If you needed to be admitted to the hospital but no inpatient bed is available, would you prefer to be kept in an ER hallway or a hallway on an inpatient ward?\" Boarded patients said they would prefer ward to ED boarding, 117/213 (54.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 48.0%-61.7%). Patients without a disposition 314/477 (65.8%; 95% CI 61.4%-70.0%) and visitors 370/532 (69.5%; 95% CI 65.4%-73.4%) stated a preference for ward boarding in 314/477 (65.8%; 95% CI 61.4%-70.0%) and in 370/532 (69.5%; 95% CI 65.4%-73.4%), respectively. Common reasons for preferring inpatient ward boarding were privacy concerns and reduced noise levels. Those preferring ED boarding valued easy access to a doctor.",
