      "original_text": "The RNA interference (RNAi) pathway is a potent antiviral defense mechanism in plants and invertebrates, in response to which viruses evolved suppressors of RNAi. In mammals, the first line of defense is mediated by the type I interferon system (IFN); however, the degree to which RNAi contributes to antiviral defense is still not completely understood. Recent work suggests that antiviral RNAi is active in undifferentiated stem cells and that antiviral RNAi can be uncovered in differentiated cells in which the IFN system is inactive or in infections with viruses lacking putative viral suppressors of RNAi. In this review, we describe the mechanism of RNAi and its antiviral functions in insects and mammals. We draw parallels and highlight differences between (antiviral) RNAi in these classes of animals and discuss open questions for future research. Figure 1. The small interfering RNA (siRNA) pathway in Drosophila melanogaster. Double-stranded 93 RNA precursors of different sources are processed by Dicer-2 into short interfering RNAs of ~21 nt in 94 size. The siRNA duplex is loaded into an Argonaute2 containing RISC complex, where one strand 95 (passenger) is degraded, and the guide strand is retained. The guide strand mediates target RNA 96 recognition through Watson-Crick base pairing, followed by target cleavage (slicing) by Argonaute.",

Viruses 2019, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 32 189 Figure 4. The RNA interference (RNAi) pathway in mammals. A single Dicer protein processes long 190 dsRNA into siRNAs and pre-miRNAs into miRNA duplexes. These small RNAs are loaded into an 191 Argonaute containing RISC complex, from which one of the strands is eliminated and degraded. The 192 other strand, referred to as guide strand (for siRNAs) or the mature miRNA (for miRNAs), is retained 193 and used to guide Argonaute onto target RNAs, resulting in cleavage (siRNA) or translational 194 inhibition or target RNA destabilization (miRNA). The scheme shows the cytoplasmic stage of the 195 miRNA pathway; the nuclear stage (pri-miRNA transcription, processing, and pre-miRNA nuclear 196 export) is not shown. 197 The miRISC complex is guided by the miRNA to target sites typically located in the 3\u0027 UTRs of 198 mRNAs [77]. Target recognition is initiated by a short nucleotide stretch at the 5\u0027 end of the miRNA 199 (position 2-8), the so-called seed sequence, accompanied with various degree of base pairing at the 200 3\u0027 end [77,95-97]. Mechanisms for miRNA-mediated gene silencing include translational repression, 201 de-adenylation, and enhancement of mRNA decay [77,98,99]. The majority of mRNAs is estimated 202 to be regulated by miRNAs [100], and post-transcriptional regulation by miRNAs is thus implicated 203 in almost all cell biological processes.",
