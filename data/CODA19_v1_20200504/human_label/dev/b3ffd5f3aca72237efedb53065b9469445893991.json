Here, we showed that induction of airway memory CD4 + T cells specific for a conserved epitope shared by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is a potential strategy for developing pancoronavirus vaccines. Airway memory CD4 + T cells differed phenotypically and functionally from lungderived cells and were crucial for protection against both CoVs in mice. Protection was dependent on interferon-g and required early induction of robust innate and virus-specific CD8 + T cell responses. The conserved epitope was also recognized in SARS-CoV-and MERS-CoV-infected human leukocyte antigen DR2 and DR3 transgenic mice, indicating potential relevance in human populations. Additionally, this epitope was cross-protective between human and bat CoVs, the progenitors for many human CoVs. Vaccine strategies that induce airway memory CD4 + T cells targeting conserved epitopes might have broad applicability in the context of new CoVs and other respiratory virus outbreaks.",
