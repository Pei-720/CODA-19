      "original_text": "Bovine respiratory disease complex is a very important health problem around the world. Present study describes serological distribution of bovine major respiratory viruses in non -vaccinated cattle population of Marmara region in north-western Turkey. Neutralising antibodies specific to bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (PI-3), bovine adenovirus serotype 1 (BAV-1) and serotype 3 (BAV-3) were investigated. Among 584 serum samples collected from 39 establishments in 7 provinces, 41.4% were positive for BVDV, 17.1% for BHV-1, 73.0% for BRSV, 43.0% for PI-3, 89.5% for BAV-1 and 92.3% for BAV-3. There were significant differences observed between seroprevalence rates detected in neighbouring provinces. Serological prevalence of BVDV, BHV-1 and BRSV were extremely higher in large capacity dairy farms than of small capacity farms (p\u003c0.0001). This study demonstrates that herd capacity is a very important risk factor for respiratory viruses and, on the other hand bovine adenoviruses and BRSV are the common reason of respiratory diseases in the region.",
