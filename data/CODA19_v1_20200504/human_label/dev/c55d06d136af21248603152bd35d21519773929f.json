Similarly, measles-negative antibody (\u003c 8) control colostrum was orally administered to 5 patients. As a clinical assessment, disability scores developed by the International Federation of Multiple Sclerosis Societies were used. As a result, of 7 high NT titre (512-5120) anti-measles colostrum recipients 5 patients improved and 2 remained unchanged. Among 8 low NT titre (8-32) anti-measles colostrum recipients 5 patients improved and 3 remained unchanged. However, of 5 negative NT titre (\u003c 8) colostrum recipients 2 patients remained unchanged and 3 worsened. No side-effects were observed in colostrum recipients. These findings suggest the efficacy of orally administered anti-measles colostrum in improving the condition of MS patients (19 \u003c 0.05).",
