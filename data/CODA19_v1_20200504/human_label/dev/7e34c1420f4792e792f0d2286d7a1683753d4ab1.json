      "original_text": "Coronaviruses are the largest RNA viruses and they are enveloped with positivestrand genomes of 26-32 kb, and they are distributed globally in a wide range of animals and humans [7] . The coronaviruses are classified in four genera based on phylogenetic analysis: alpha-coronaviruses, beta-coronaviruses, gammacoronaviruses, and delta-coronaviruses [7] . Some strains of coronaviruses, HCoV-OC43 [a beta-coronavirus] and HCoV-229E [an alpha-coronavirus], are causative agents of the common cold and rarely severe respiratory disease [8, 9] . Other newly discovered human coronaviruses, HCoV-NL634 and HCoV-HKU1, are occasionally associated with severe lower respiratory tract infection in infants and immunocompromised patients [10, 11] . SARS-CoV is a lineage B betacoronavirus and MERS-CoV is a novel beta-coronavirus of lineage C, and both these viruses appear to have crossed the species barrier from bats to humans [12, 13] . Bats are reservoirs for many mammalian coronaviruses [13] [14] [15] . Various SARS-like coronaviruses have been found in bats from China, Asia, and Europe, but none were considered as direct progenitor of SARS-CoV. Recently, however, investigators from China reported whole genome sequences of two novel bat coronaviruses from Chinese horseshoe bats closely related to SARS-CoV [16] . The receptor-binding domain of the spike protein was very similar to that of SARS-CoV, and one of the isolates [bat SL-CoV-w1V1] uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [ACE2] from humans, civets, and Chinese horseshoe bats for cell entry [16] . SARS-CoV was previously shown to use human ACE2 molecule as its entry receptor, an outstanding feature of its cross-species transmissibility [17] . Thus, the bat SL-CoV-WIVI may be the ancestor virus that precedes the evolution of SARS-CoV in humans.",
