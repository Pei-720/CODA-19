      "original_text": ". Integrin knockdown efficiency. (A -D) HaCaT cells were transfected with control, integrin α6 or integrin α3 siRNA. After 2 days, cell lysates were analyzed for (A and C) integrin α6 or (B and D) integrin α3 by Western blot analysis using actin as loading control. Two lysates per condition are shown. For full Western blots see Figures S18 -S21. Integrin band intensities were related to actin band intensities. The average of the control lysates for each biological replicate was set to 100%. Values are given as means ± SD (n \u003d 6 -8 lysates collected from 3 -4 biological replicates). The unpaired Student\u0027s t-test compares the control to the knockdown (***, p \u003c 0.001). (E and F). Example images from an experiment in which membrane sheets from control and knockdown cells were generated and immunostained for (E) Integrin α6 or (F) integrin α3. Upper panels show membranes visualized by the membrane dye TMA-DPH, lower panels the respective integrin immunostainings. Images are displayed employing greyscale (TMA-DPH) and red (integrins) linear lookup tables. For E and F different scalings were applied, although all panels from one channel in E or F have the same arbitrary scaling. Please note that after knockdown the integrin antibodies hardly recognize any protein.",
