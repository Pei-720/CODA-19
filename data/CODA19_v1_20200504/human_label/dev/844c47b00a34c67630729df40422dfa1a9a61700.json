      "original_text": "Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) exists in several closely related serotypes with varying degrees of pathogenicity in mice (8). A number of studies have shown a correlation between the pathogenicity of a certain type of virus and its ability to grow in cultured maeroph~ges (3, 9) . Thus, the non-pathogenic MHV 1 does not replicate in mouse macrophages (1), whereas the pathogenie types MHV2 and MHV3 readily infect mouse peritoneal macrophages (2, 7, 11, 12) . Most strains of mice can be infected with MHV3 with the development of fu]minant hepatitis. Previous studies using A/J strain mice showed that these mice were resistant to MHV3 infection, with only a mild disease occurring with large doses of virus (4, 12). During the first four days of infection virus was recovered from infected mice although there were only minimal changes to their livers (4). However, young A/J strain mice were susceptible up to 3 weeks of age (4). Other mouse strains, including the C57 strain (4, 5, 12) and the A/Sn strain (5) were sensitive to MHV3 infection. Furthermore, VIaELIZIER and ALLISON (12) have reported that there was no detectable growth of MHV3 in macrophagcs from A/J mice; whilst MHV3 replicated in maerophages from C57 strain mice. We were interested in analysing this reported resistance of A/J strain mouse macrophages to MHV3 infection and attempted to repeat this observation by comparing the effect of MHV3 infection on C57, A/Sn and A/J strain mice and their macrophages.",
