Using an m 6 A-modified hairpin present in the Kaposi\u0027s sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV) ORF50 RNA, we identified seven members from the \u0027Royal family\u0027 as putative m 6 A readers, including SND1. RIP-seq and eCLIP analysis characterised the SND1 binding profile transcriptome-wide, revealing SND1 as an m 6 A reader. We further demonstrate that the m 6 A modification of the ORF50 RNA is critical for SND1 binding, which in turn stabilises the ORF50 transcript. Importantly, SND1 depletion leads to inhibition of KSHV early gene expression showing that SND1 is essential for KSHV lytic replication. This work demonstrates that members of the \u0027Royal family\u0027 have m 6 A-reading ability, greatly increasing their epigenetic functions beyond protein methylation.",
