Although rodent models of ZEBOV infection are useful for screening prospective countermeasures, they are frequently not useful for prediction of effi cacy in the more stringent non-human primate models. We therefore assessed the effi cacy of modifi ed non-immunostimulatory siRNAs in a uniformly lethal non-human primate model of ZEBOV haemorrhagic fever.",
