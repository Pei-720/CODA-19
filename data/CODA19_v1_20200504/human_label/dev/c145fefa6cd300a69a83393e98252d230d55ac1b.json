It relies on supply from Mainland China with other cities rivalling access. Yet there is still no great impetus for water conservation. This paper reports on progress in setting up a pilot biological wastewater treatment plant and a PV-powered UV-LED disinfection system plus a feasibility study carried out in conjunction with a local developer investigating the application of the treated water for irrigation. The objective is to incorporate the systems within a small-scale community for its contribution to water and energy conservation as well as establish the parameters for replication in other countries with potential up-scaling for urban application. r",
