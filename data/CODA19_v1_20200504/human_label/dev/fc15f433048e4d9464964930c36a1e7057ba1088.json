The CoV spike (S) glycoprotein is a 3 key target for urgently needed vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and diagnostics. To facilitate 4 medical countermeasure (MCM) development we determined a 3.5 Å-resolution cryo-EM 5 structure of the 2019-nCoV S trimer in the prefusion conformation. The predominant state of the 6 trimer has one of the three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) rotated up in a receptor-accessible 7 conformation. We also show biophysical and structural evidence that the 2019-nCoV S binds 8 ACE2 with higher affinity than SARS-CoV S. Additionally we tested several published SARS-9",
