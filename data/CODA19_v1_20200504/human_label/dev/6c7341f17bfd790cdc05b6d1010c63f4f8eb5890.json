Initial trial arms will be best usual primary care, and best usual primary care plus treatment with oseltamivir for five days. We aim to recruit at least 2500 participants ≥1 year old presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI), with symptom duration ≤72 hours in primary care over three consecutive periods of confirmed high influenza incidence. Participant outcomes will be followed-up to 28 days by diary and telephone. The primary objective is to determine whether adding antiviral treatment to best usual primary care is effective in reducing time to return to usual daily activity with fever, head-and muscle-ache reduced to minor severity or less. Secondary objectives include determining cost-effectiveness, benefits in subgroups of participants according to age (\u003c12, 12-64, \u003e64 years), severity of symptoms (low, medium, high), comorbidity (yes/no), and duration of symptoms (≤48hours/\u003e48-72 hours), decrease in",
