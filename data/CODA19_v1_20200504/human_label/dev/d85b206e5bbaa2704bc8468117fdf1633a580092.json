Therefore, prediction of peptide-MHC binding is the main basis for anticipating T-cell epitopes. A very popular and accurate method to predict peptide-MHC binding is based on motif-profi les and here we show how to make them using EPIMHC ( http://imed.med.ucm.es/epimhc/ ). EPIMHC is a database of T-cell epitopes and MHC-binding peptides that unlike any related resource provides a framework for computational vaccinology. In this chapter, we describe how to derive peptide-MHC binding motif-profi les in EPIMHC and use them to predict peptide-MHC binding and T-cell epitopes. Moreover, we show evidence that customization of peptide-MHC binding predictors can lead to enhanced epitope predictions.",
