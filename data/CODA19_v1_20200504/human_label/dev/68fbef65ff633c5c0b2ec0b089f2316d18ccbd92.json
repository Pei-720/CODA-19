Further, their 52 impact on clinical outcomes and anti-infective use was discussed with a focus on ED-based 53 studies. 54 Implications: Clinicians should be familiar with the distinctive features of each RDT and 55 individual performance characteristics for each target. Their integration into ED workflow 56 should be pre-planned considering local constraints of given settings.
