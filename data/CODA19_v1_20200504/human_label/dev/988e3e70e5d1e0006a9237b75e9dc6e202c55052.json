      "original_text": "Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are frequent and potentially serious episodes that permanently affect patients\u0027 quality of life and lung function. Up to 75% of exacerbations are caused by bacteria, sometimes associated with viral infection. Outpatient treatment of exacerbations is unsuccessful in 20-25% of patients and the main risk factor for this lack of success is the severity of the underlying disease. Persistent bacterial colonization is a risk factor for frequent and severe exacerbations and for rapid progression of COPD. Therefore, antibiotic treatment should aim to achieve not only the resolution of symptons but also the best eradication possible to hasten recovery and prevent recurrences. New clinical trials have demonstrated that the antibiotic that best achieves bacterial eradication can prolong exacerbation-free periods.",
