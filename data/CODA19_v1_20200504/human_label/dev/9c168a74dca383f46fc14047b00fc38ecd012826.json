      "original_text": "For centuries, the rapid spread and cure of infectious diseases have been a major concern to the progress and survival of humans. These diseases are the global burden and the prominent cause for the worldwide deaths and disability. Nanomedicine has emerged as the most excellent tool to eradicate and halt their spread. Various nanoformulations (NFs) using advanced nanotechnology are in demand. Recently, hydrogel and nanogel based drug delivery devices poses new prospects to simulate the natural intelligence of various biological systems. Owing to their unique porous interpenetrating network design, hydrophobic drug incorporation and stimulus sensitivity hydrogels owe excellent potential as targeted drug delivery system. Present review is an attempt to highlight the recent trends of hydrogel based drug delivery systems for the delivery of therapeutic agents and diagnostics for the major infectious diseases including Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), Malaria, Tuberculosis, Influenza and Ebola. Future prospective and challenges are also briefed. Nanomedicine actively target locations by the use of various NFs 14 as a DDS which include nanoparticles, 8 polymeric micelles, 15, 16 nanorods, 17, 18 nanospheres, 19, 20 solid lipid nanoparticles, 21, 22 nanolipososmes, 23, 24 dendrimers, 25, 26 metal nanoparticles 27, 28 , fullerenes and quantum dots. 29, 30 These NFs have been useful in the development of the various different routes like systemic, oral, pulmonary, transdermal and have been helpful for the drug targeting and On-demand drug delivery techniques. 31 The technologies of Vashist et al.",
