      "original_text": "The non-structural protein Nsp10 of coronaviruses is a small cleavage product of the viral replicase polyprotein that has been implicated in RNA synthesis. Nsp10 of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) displays an apparent molecular mass of 13-16 kDa in reducing SDS-PAGE and analytical gel filtration, while dynamic light scattering suggests the existence of oligomeric forms. Atomic absorption spectroscopy reveals two metal ions per Nsp10 monomer, with a preference for Zn 2+ over Fe 2+/3+ and Co 2+ . These are probably bound by two Zn-finger-like motifs. Moreover, MHV Nsp10 interacts with tRNA, single-stranded RNA, double-stranded DNA and, to a lesser extent, singlestranded DNA as shown by gel-shift experiments. The K d for tRNA is 2.1 ± 0.2 lM.",
