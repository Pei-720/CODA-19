The present study first screened that the DEAD-box RNA helicase 5 (DDX5) was a cellular protein interacting with the Nsp9 of PRRSV by a yeast two-hybrid method in a pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) cDNA library. Next, DDX5 was shown to interact with viral Nsp9 in the co-transfected HEK293 cells with the DDX5-and Nsp9-expressing plasmids, and the interaction between endogenous DDX5 and Nsp9 was also confirmed in MARC-145 cells infected with the Nsp9-expressing lentiviruses. Then, the interacting domains between DDX5 and Nsp9 were determined to be the DEXDc and HELICc domains in DDX5 and the RdRp domain in Nsp9, respectively. Moreover, in the HEK293 cells, MARC-145 cells and PAM cell lines co-transfected with the DDX5and Nsp9-expressing plasmids, Nsp9 was shown to co-localize with DDX5 in the cytoplasm with a perinuclear pattern, and meanwhile in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells and PAMs, endogenous DDX5 was also found to co-localize with Nsp9. Finally, silencing the DDX5 gene in MARC-145 cells significantly impacted the replication of PRRSV, and while the over-expression of DDX5 could slightly enhance viral replication. These findings indicate that DDX5 positively regulates the replication of PRRSV via its interaction with viral Nsp9 in vitro.",
