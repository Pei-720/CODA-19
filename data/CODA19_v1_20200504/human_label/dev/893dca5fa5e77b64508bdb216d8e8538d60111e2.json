      "original_text": "Cholesterol represents one of the key constituents of small, dynamic, sterol-and sphingolipid-enriched domains on the plasma membrane. It has been reported that many viruses depend on plasma membrane cholesterol for efficient infection. In this study, the role of the plasma membrane cholesterol in porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection of MARC-145 cells was investigated. Pretreatment of MARC-145 cells with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), a drug used to deplete cholesterol from cellular membrane, significantly reduced PRRSV infection in a dose-dependent manner. This inhibition was partially reversed by supplementing exogenous cholesterol following MβCD treatment, suggesting that the inhibition of PRRSV infection was specifically mediated by removal of cellular cholesterol. Further detailed studies showed that depletion of cellular membrane cholesterol significantly inhibited virus entry, especially virus attachment and release. These results indicate that the presence of cholesterol in the cellular membrane is a key component of PRRSV infection. porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), cholesterol, virus entry, release, membrane fusion Citation: Sun Y, Xiao S B, Wang D, et al.
