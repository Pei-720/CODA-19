Infectious bronchitis virus has many serotypes that do not confer cross protection against each other. The current study was designed to know which IBV types were circulating in Jordanian broiler chickens. Tracheal swabs from 175 broiler flocks at the acute phase of respiratory disease were collected. The swabs were subjected to RNA extraction and tested by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Specific-nested PCR were performed on RT-PCR products to detect and differentiate strains of Massachusetts, 4/91, and D274 types. The nucleic acid of IBV was de-",
