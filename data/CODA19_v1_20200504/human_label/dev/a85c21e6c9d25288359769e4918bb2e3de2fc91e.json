      "original_text": "A newly developed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was further validated to confirm cutoff values and evaluate its diagnostic performance with clinical samples. In parallel, an immunochromatographic test was also evaluated. A total of 227 clinical serum specimens collected from SARS patients were used in the study, together with 385 samples from healthy donors. By use of an immunofluorescent (IF) test as the \"gold standard, \" both the ELISA and the immunochromatographic test were able to detect immunoglobulin G antibodies to SARS not only from late-convalescent-stage samples (\u003e21 days from the onset of clinical symptoms), as previously established, but also from early-acute-phase samples (1 to 10 days from onset). The ELISA, using an optical density (OD) of 0.25 as its cutoff value, produced the best sensitivity while maintaining high specificity. It detected SARS-specific antibodies in 58, 70, 75, and 95%, respectively, of the four groups of samples collected from patients 1 to 10 days, 11 to 20 days, 21 to 30 days, and more than 30 days after the onset of clinical symptoms. Similarly, the immunochromatographic test detected SARS-specific antibodies in 55, 68, 81, and 79% of the four groups, respectively. The overall specificities for the ELISA and the rapid test were 99.5 and 97.7%, respectively. Although the positive correlation observed between the ELISA OD values and the IF titers was moderate (r ‫؍‬ 0.6915; P \u003c 0.001), the detection rates of both the ELISA and the rapid test were found well in agreement with the IF titers. on March 24, 2020 by guest http://cvi.asm.org/ Downloaded from c Given as number of true positives detected/total number of samples testing positive (percent). d PPV and NPV were calculated by using the results for healthy donors from Hong Kong [HD (HK)] and those for SARS patients (total) obtained at the same testing site in Hong Kong. e NPV, number of true negatives detected/total number of samples testing negative (percent). 700 GUAN ET AL.
