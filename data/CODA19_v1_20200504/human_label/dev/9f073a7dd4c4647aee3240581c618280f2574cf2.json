This component of the system acts to oppose the vasoconstrictor and proliferative effects on angiotensin II through signaling mechanisms mediated by the mas receptor. In addition, a reduced expression of the vasodepressor axis composed by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and angiotensin-(1-7) may contribute to the expression of essential hypertension, the remodeling of heart and renal function associated with this disease, and even the physiology of pregnancy and the development of eclampsia.",
