      "original_text": "Many of us were drawn to the specialty of dermatology by the excitement of recognizing key dermatologic features that led to the diagnoses of important systemic disorders. Although there is significant overlap between the skin signs of systemic disease in children and adults, there are several conditions in which important distinctions exist in the characteristic clinical presentation. Our author, Dr. Amy Gilliam, has special experience and expertise in pediatric rheumatologic disorders. In an interesting case-based format, Dr. Gilliam provides a comprehensive overview of the clinical findings in several rheumatologic conditions that are more specific to children in contrast to their adult counterparts. Furthermore, she provides an update on diagnosis and management of several uniquely pediatric disorders including neonatal lupus erythematosis, childhood vasculitides (Kawasaki disease, Henoch Schonlein Purpura, acute hemorrhagic edema of infancy) and the more recently described neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disorder (NOMID) syndrome. This article provides clinically relevant information that may aid the clinician in the accurate and prompt recognition of these challenging diseases. Timely diagnosis will hopefully result in more effective therapy as well as prevention of disease-related complications that may ultimately improve the outcomes in these complex patients.",
