Here, we studied whether these patches are defined architectures with features for virus binding and/ or internalization. Super-resolution microscopy reveals that the patches are assemblies of closely associated nanoclusters of CD151, integrin α3 and integrin α6. Integrin α6 is required for virus attachment and integrin α3 for endocytosis. We propose that CD151 organizes viral entry platforms with different types of integrin clusters for different functionalities. Since numerous viruses use tetraspanin patches, we speculate that this building principle is a blueprint for cell-surface architectures utilized by viral particles.",

To clarify the role of integrin α3 in the infection of keratinocytes, we infected integrin α3 depleted HaCaT cells by incubation with HPV16 pseudovirions (PsVs). For positive control, cells were depleted from integrin α6, which is required for infection of HeLa and KH-SV cells 5,21 . In Western blot analysis, knockdown reduced integrin α6 and integrin α3 protein levels by 87% and 97%, respectively (Fig. S1 ). Intracellular processing of the L1 virus capsid protein was monitored by Western blot analysis and by microscopy. In the Western blots, we quantified the ~25 kDa cleavage product of L1, which is generated only after internalization and lysosomal degradation of the virus 22 . As seen in Fig. 1A , knockdown of integrin α3 and integrin α6 reduced the cleavage product by 73% and 44%, respectively. For microscopy, we employed antibody-detection of the L1-7 epitope, which only becomes detectable after intracellular capsid disassembly 4,23 . Knockdown of either one of the integrins reduced the number of L1-7 positive organelles to about 65% (Fig. 1B,C) .
