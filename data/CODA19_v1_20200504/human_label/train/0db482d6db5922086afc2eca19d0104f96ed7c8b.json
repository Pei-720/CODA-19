      "original_text": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the major causes of acute lower respiratory tract infection worldwide. The absence of a commercial vaccine and the limited success of current therapeutic strategies against RSV make further research necessary. We used a multi-cohort analysis approach to investigate host transcriptomic biomarkers and shed further light on the molecular mechanism underlying RSV-host interactions. We meta-analyzed seven transcriptome microarray studies from the public Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository containing a total of 922 samples, including RSV, healthy controls, coronaviruses, enteroviruses, influenzas, rhinoviruses, and coinfections, from both adult and pediatric patients. We identified \u003e 1500 genes differentially expressed when comparing the transcriptomes of RSV-infected patients against healthy controls. Functional enrichment analysis showed several pathways significantly altered, including immunologic response mediated by RSV infection, pattern recognition receptors, cell cycle, and olfactory signaling. In addition, we identified a minimal 17-transcript host signature specific for RSV infection by comparing transcriptomic profiles against other respiratory viruses. These multi-genic signatures might help to investigate future drug targets against RSV infection. remain unknown [10] . The notable impact of pediatric respiratory diseases produced by RSV in the health system raises the need for a more in-depth understanding of the molecular mechanism responsible for the host susceptibility to the infection. This would improve the development of new preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic strategies, which could reduce the social, medical, and economic burden of the disease [11] .",
