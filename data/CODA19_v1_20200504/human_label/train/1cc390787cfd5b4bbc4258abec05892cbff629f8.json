      "original_text": "The Mediterranean diet is rich in fruits and vegetables, monounsaturated fatty acids from olive oil, and is complemented with the traditional use of culinary and medicinal herbs and spices. An important feature of this diet is the negative association with the incidence of metabolic syndrome, which is characterized by increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Conformity to the Mediterranean diet has also been linked to a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer in US populations. Plants that originated in the Mediterranean basin have been used for centuries in botanical therapies. Many of these plants are believed to prevent and/or cure a wide spectrum of ailments based on their content in bioactive components that exert anti-oxidant, anti-infl ammatory, anticarcinogenic, anti-diabetic, and anti-thrombotic functions. This chapter underlines the health benefi ts that may derive from utilization through dietary assumption or medicinal applications of a selected group of plant products including extracts and specifi c bioactive components found in rosemary, licorice, chamomile, and olive oil. Each section provides a scientifi c analysis of the most recent literature and attempts to highlight the mechanisms of action and molecular targets of bioactive components derived from these plants.",
