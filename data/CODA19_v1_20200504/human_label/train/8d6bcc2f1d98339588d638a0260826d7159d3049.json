      "original_text": "Background: Thymus transplantation is a promising strategy for the treatment of athymic complete DiGeorge syndrome (cDGS). Methods: Twelve patients with cDGS underwent transplantation with allogeneic cultured thymus. Objective: We sought to confirm and extend the results previously obtained in a single center. Results: Two patients died of pre-existing viral infections without having thymopoiesis, and 1 late death occurred from autoimmune thrombocytopenia. One infant had septic shock shortly after transplantation, resulting in graft loss and the need for a second transplant. Evidence of thymopoiesis developed from 5 to 6 months after transplantation in 10 patients. Median circulating naive CD4 counts were 44 3 10 6 /L (range, 11-440 3 10 6 /L) and 200 3 10 6 /L (range, 5-310 3 10 6 /L) at 12 and 24 months after transplantation and T-cell receptor excision circles were 2,238/10 6 T cells (range, 320-8,807/10 6 T cells) and 4,184/10 6 T cells (range, 1,582-24,596/",
