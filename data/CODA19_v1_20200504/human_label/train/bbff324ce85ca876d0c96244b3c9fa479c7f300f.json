The proliferative and survival signals in these proliferation centers include interactions with T lymphocytes expressing CD40 ligand. We have demonstrated that the low toxicity combination of bezafibrate and medroxyprogesterone acetate induces mitochondrial superoxide-mediated apoptosis of non-CD40-liganded cells but not of cells exposed to CD40 ligand. Here, we assessed the ability of dasatinib and lycorine to restore bezafibrate-and medroxyprogesterone acetate-induced apoptosis in cells exposed to CD40 ligand. In parallel experiments we compared the ability of dasatinib to induce apoptosis of cells co-treated with fludarabine.",
