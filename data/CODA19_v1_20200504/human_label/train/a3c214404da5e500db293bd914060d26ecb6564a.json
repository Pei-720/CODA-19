Method: Children coinfected with HBoV between January 2012 and December 2014 were enrolled and retrospectively reviewed. Result: A total of 984 patients were stratified into five groups: HBoV infection alone (n ¼ 249), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection alone (n ¼ 649), HBoV coinfection with RSV (n ¼ 28), with human rhinovirus (HRV) (n ¼ 39) and with other virus (n ¼ 19). Length of hospitalization was longer in HBoV coinfection with RSV group than HBoV (9.0 days vs. 7.0 days, p ¼ 0.001), RSV (9.0 days vs. 8.0 days, p ¼ 0.016) infection alone group. Pneumonia was more common in the HBoV coinfection with RSV group compared with the HBoV, RSV infection alone group, respectively (75.0% vs. 44.2%, 31.3%, p \u003c 0.001). HBoV DNA copy numbers (383 000 copies/ml) were positively correlated with the length of hospitalization (r ¼ 0.334, p \u003c 0.001).",
