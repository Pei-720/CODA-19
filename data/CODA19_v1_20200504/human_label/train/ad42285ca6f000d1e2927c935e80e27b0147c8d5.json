      "original_text": "In this study, 96 diarrheic and 77 non-diarrheic fecal samples from dairy calves were collected from 14 dairy farms in 4 provinces to investigate the molecular prevalence and genomic characteristics of Bovine Kobuvirus (BKoV) in China. The results showed that the BKoV positive rate for the diarrheic feces (35.42%) was significantly higher than that for the non-diarrheic feces (11.69%, p \u003c 0.001). Interestingly, three potential novel VP1 lineages were identified from 15 complete VP1 sequences, and a unique triple nucleotide insertion which can result in an aa insertion, was first observed in the 11/12 VP0 fragments with 660 bp long in this study, compared with known BKoV VP0 sequences. Moreover, the first Chinese BKoV genome was successfully obtained from a diarrheic fecal sample, named CHZ/CHINA. The open reading frame (ORF) of the genome from strain CHZ/China shares 87.4%-88.3% nucleotide (nt) and 93.7%-96.4% amino acid (aa) identity, compared with the three known genomes of BKoV. Interestingly, phylogenetic tree based on aa sequences of these genomes showed that CHZ/CHINA was clustered into an independent branch, suggesting the strain may represent a novel BKoV strain. The findings contribute to better understanding the molecular characteristics and evolution of BKoV.",
