      "original_text": "The effects of glass surfaces and probe GC content on signal intensities of a 60-mer diagnostic microarray were studied. Twelve virus-specific oligonucleotide probes for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were divided into a high GC content group (≥ 50%) and a low GC content group (\u003c 50%), and spotted onto four different chemically-modified glass surfaces: a poly-amine coating activated by 1,4-phenylene diisothiocyanate (Poly-Amine surface), an acrylic acid-co-acrylamide copolymer coating activated by 1-(3-dimethylamino propyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride and N-hydroxysuccinimide (AACA-Copolymer surface), a commercial Corning CMT-GAPS amino surface, and a Telechem SuperAmine amino surface. RNA samples from cultured SARS-CoV strain were labelled using direct cDNA labelling with restriction display in a single colour format. The background-subtracted signal intensities were analysed using two-way analysis of variance. The effects of glass surfaces on background-subtracted signal intensities were significant (p \u003d 0.003). Multiple comparisons showed that differences existed mainly between the AACA-Copolymer surface and the other glass surfaces, and that the AACA-Copolymer surface had the highest background-subtracted signal intensity. The probe GC content had no significant effect on signal intensities in the narrow range of GC content represented (p \u003d 0.07). The results suggested that the AACA-Copolymer surface may be a novel choice of microorganism survey based on long oligonucleotide microarray.",
