      "original_text": "An optical sensor for berberine, the basic ingredient of the widely used traditional Chinese medicine Coptis Chinensis, based on its intrinsic fluorescence enhanced by butylated-␤-cyclodextrin (HDB-␤-CD) immobilized in plasticized poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) membrane has been developed. The drastic enhancement of fluorescence intensity of berberine was attributed to the formation of an inclusion complex between HDB-␤-CD and berberine, which has been utilized as the basis of the fabrication of a berberine-sensitive fluorescence sensor. The proposed sensor was quite distinct from those fluorescent sensors for berberine reported so far which relied upon quenching the fluorescence of the sensing reagent immobilized on membrane by berberine. The response mechanism of optode membrane was discussed in detail from the view of molecular dynamics and the optimum steric configuration of the inclusion complex was presented by molecular dynamics simulation. The analytical performance characteristics of the proposed berberine-sensitive sensor were investigated. The sensor can be applied to the quantification of berberine with a linear range covering from 4.0 × 10 −7 to 2.0 × 10 −5 mol l −1 with a detection limit of 8.0 × 10 −8 mol l −1 . The sensor exhibits excellent reproducibility, reversibility and selectivity. The recommended method was successfully used for the determination of berberine in pharmaceutical preparations.",
