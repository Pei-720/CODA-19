      "original_text": "Inhibitors of bacterial DD-peptidases represent potential antibiotics. In the search for alternatives to β-lactams, we have investigated a series of compounds designed to generate transition state analogue structures on reaction with DD-peptidases. The compounds contain a combination of a peptidoglycan-mimetic specificity handle and a warhead capable of delivering a tetrahedral anion to the enzyme active site. The latter include a boronic acid, two alcohols, an aldehyde and a trifluoroketone. The compounds were tested against two low molecular mass class C DDpeptidases. As expected from previous observations, the boronic acid was a potent inhibitor, but, rather unexpectedly from precedent, the trifluoroketone [D-α-aminopimelyl-(1,1,1-trifluoro-3amino)butan-2-one] was also very effective. Taking into account competing hydration, the trifluoroketone was the strongest inhibitor of the Actinomadura R39 DD-peptidase, with a subnanomolar (free ketone) inhibition constant. A crystal structure of the complex between the trifluoroketone and the R39 enzyme showed that a tetrahedral adduct had indeed formed with the active site serine nucleophile. The trifluoroketone moiety, therefore, should be considered along with boronic acids and phosphonates, as a warhead that can be incorporated into new and effective DD-peptidase inhibitors and therefore, perhaps, antibiotics.",
