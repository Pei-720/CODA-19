      "original_text": "Infectious bronchitis (IB) generated by the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes economic difficulties for livestock farmers. The 3D8 single chain variable fragment (scFv) protein is a recombinant antibody with nuclease activity that shows antiviral effects against various DNA and RNA viruses in mice and chickens. In this experiment, 3D8 scFv G 2 transgenic chickens produced by crossing 3D8 scFv G 1 transgenic rooster and wild type hens were screened by genomic PCR and immunohistochemistry analysis. 3D8 scFv transgenic chickens, wild type sibling chickens, and SPF chickens were directly infected with IBV (5 chickens per group) and indirectly infected by airborne propagation (15 chickens per group). The relative IBV shedding titers were measured by quantitative real-time PCR using oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs on days 3 and 5 after intraocular infection. The viral load was significantly decreased in the 3D8 scFv transgenic chickens from the contact transmission group. Additionally, blood was collected from each group on day 17 post-infection. The ELISA results showed a marked reduction of the antibody titer against IBV in the 3D8 scFv transgenic chickens from the contact transmission group. These results suggest that the 3D8 scFv protein potentially inhibits infectious bronchitis virus transmission in chickens.",
