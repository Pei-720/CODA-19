A number of alternate approaches are being pursued to generate cross-protective, dose-sparing, safe, and effective vaccines, as traditional vaccine approaches, i.e., embryonated egg-grown, are not immunogenic. We developed a replicationincompetent adenoviral vector-based, adjuvant-and egg-independent pandemic influenza vaccine strategy as a potential alternative to conventional egg-derived vaccines.",
