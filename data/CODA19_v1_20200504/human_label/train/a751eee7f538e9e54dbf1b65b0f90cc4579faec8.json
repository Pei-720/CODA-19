      "original_text": "Two coronaviruses, SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) and MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) caused large-scale severe respiratory syndromes in humans in 2002 and 2013, respectively 1, 2 . A recent outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China declared in December 12 th 2019 led to the isolation and identification of a new human coronavirus, 2019-nCoV (SARS-CoV-2), as the responsible agent of this new acute respiratory syndrome 3 . Since, SARS-CoV-2 and the Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) have spread to more than 200 countries and territories worldwide affecting more than 600,000 people (laboratory-confirmed cases) from which around 28,000 have died by COVID-19 4 . As such, the WHO declared COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic on March 11 th 2020 5 . Given the rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and that an important fraction of the infected individuals remains asymptomatic but still spread the virus 6 , rapid and extensive diagnosis together with the isolation of infected individuals remains as one of the most powerful ways to avoid the spread of new COVID-19 cases. There are several RT-qPCR protocols from different countries that are currently approved by the WHO in order to detect SARS-CoV-2 7 . However, one of the limiting steps of such protocols is RNA extraction from clinical samples, which is currently performed by the use of a limited quantity of approved RNA extraction kits. Since the current demand for those kits largely exceeds their offer, it is necessary to develop alternative strategies allowing a rapid detection of the virus. This becomes more important in middle-and low-income countries, which will not have massive access to kit-based diagnosis 8, 9 . In this sense, it was recently reported that the detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR from a mixed sample could be achieved with non-approved kits but also in the absence of an RNA extraction process 10 . Here, we have extended these preliminary observations by using an RNA extraction-free SARS-CoV-2 detection protocol from nasopharyngeal swab samples from two COVID-19 diagnosed individuals using two commercially available and broadly used RT-qPCR kits. Our data indicate that RNA extraction can be omitted from the protocol at least with one of the tested kits allowing the rapid and reliable detection of SARS-CoV-2 directly from nasopharyngeal swabs samples.",
