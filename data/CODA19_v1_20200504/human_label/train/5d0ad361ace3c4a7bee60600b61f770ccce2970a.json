Inhibition of the wild-type (wt) M2 channel and the amantadine-resistant A/M2-S31N and A/M2-V27A mutant ion channels were measured in Xenopus oocytes using two-electrode voltage clamp (TEV) assays. Most of the novel compounds inhibited the wt ion channel in the low micromolar range. Of note, several compounds inhibited the A/M2 V27A mutant ion channel, one of them with submicromolar IC 50 . None of the compounds was found to inhibit the S31N mutant ion channel. The antiviral activity of three novel dual wt and A/M2-V27A channels inhibitors was confirmed by influenza virus yield assays.",
