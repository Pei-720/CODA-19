      "original_text": "Infectious bronchitis (IB) is a highly contagious disease of the respiratory and urogenital tract of chickens, caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a member of the family Coronaviridae. The disease is common throughout the world where chickens are produced commercially. PCR on reverse transcribed RNA is a potent technique for the detection of IBV. In comparison with classical detection methods, PCR-based techniques are both sensitive and fast. Dozens of serotypes and genotypes of IBV have been detected, and many more will surely be reported in future. This research was conducted to identify the infectious bronchitis virus with group specific primers of avian Coronaviruses in Zabol, southeast of Iran. Tracheal swabs were collected from eleven commercial broiler flocks and these swabs were used for RNA extraction. General primers included XCE2+ and XCE2-that amplify all IBV serotypes were used. Primers MCE1+, BCE1+ and DCE1+ was used to amplifying the specific nucleotide sequence of Massachusetts, 4/91 and D274 serotypes, respectively. The results of this study showed that 36.36% of the sampled flocks were positive to IBV by RT-PCR. Moreover, the Massachusetts was the identified serotype of infectious bronchitis virus. The results provide the first molecular evidence for the presence of infectious bronchitis virus and Massachusetts serotype in Zabol.",
