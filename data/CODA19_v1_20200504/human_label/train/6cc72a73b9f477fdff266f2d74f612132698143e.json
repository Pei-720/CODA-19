      "original_text": "In this study, infrared thermography (IRT) was assessed as a means of detecting foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV)-infected cattle before and after the development of clinical signs. Preliminary IRT imaging demonstrated that foot temperatures increased in FMDVinfected animals. The maximum foot temperatures of healthy (n \u003d 53), directly inoculated (DI) (n \u003d 12), contact (CT) (n \u003d 6), and vaccine trial (VT) (n \u003d 21) cattle were measured over the course of FMD infection. A cut-off value was established at 34.4째C (sensitivity \u003d 61.1%, specificity \u003d 87.7%) with the aim of detecting FMDV-infected animals both before and after clinical signs were observed. Seven of 12 (58%) DI and 3/6 (50%) CT animals showed maximum foot temperatures exceeding the 34.4째C cut-off before the development of foot vesicles. In contrast, only 5/21 (24%) VT animals displayed pre-clinical foot temperatures above this cut-off possibly indicating partial vaccine protection of this group. These results show IRT as a promising screening technology to quickly identify potentially infected animals for confirmatory diagnostic testing during FMD outbreaks. Further evaluation of this technology is needed to determine the value of IRT in detecting animals with mild clinical signs or sub-clinical infections. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",
