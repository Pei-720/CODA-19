The additional tests for the discrepant results were conducted by repeat RV assay or monoplex PCR coupled direct sequencing. Data analysis using percent agreement, kappa, and prevalence-adjusted and bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK) values was performed for comparisons among the three RV assays. Results: Of the 201 samples, AP, AD, and RQ detected 105 (52.2%), 99 (49.3%), and 95 (47.3%) positive cases respectively. The overall agreement, kappa, and PABAK values for the three assays ranged between 97%-98%, 0.76-0.86, and 0.93-0.96 respectively. The performance of the three assays was very similar, with 94%-100% agreement for all comparisons, each virus types. The additional testing of samples",
