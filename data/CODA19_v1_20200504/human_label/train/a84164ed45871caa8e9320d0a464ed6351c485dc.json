      "original_text": "Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) is the etiological agent of a highly contagious disease in chickens. In a recent report, proteasome inhibitor MG132 has been shown to completely inhibit IBDV-induced apoptosis. This raises the possibility that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway may be used by the virus to promote viral replication. In this study, we examined the interplay between IBDV replication and the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in cultured cells. Treatment of DF-1 cells with the proteasome inhibitors MG132 or lactacystin significantly decreased virus release in the supernatant and prevented virus-induced cytopathic effect. Inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway did reduce markedly viral RNA transcription and protein translation but not affect virus internalization. We also demonstrated that IBDV activates caspase pathway via triggering the efflux of cytochrome c in mitochondria into cytosol of infected cells. This activity was dose-dependently reduced by proteasome inhibitor treatment. Taken together, our data suggest that proteasome inhibitor reduces IBDV replication through inhibition of viral RNA transcription and protein synthesis, and thus preventing IBDV-induced apoptosis.",
