      "original_text": "Phage-displayed peptide libraries were used to map immunologically-relevant epitopes on the surface (S) glycoprotein of a neurotropic murine coronavirus (MHV-A59). Three in vitro virusneutralizing and in vivo protective mAbs against either continuous or discontinuous epitopes on the S glycoprotein were used to screen twelve different peptide libraries expressed on the pVIII major coat protein of the fd filamentous bacteriophage. Consensus sequences were identified that matched short sequences within the S glycoprotein. The sequence of a tight-binding, mAbselected peptide suggested the location of a discontinuous epitope within the N-terminal S1 subunit. Several tightly-binding phage were amplified and used directly as immunogens in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. Partial protection of C57BL/6 mice against a lethal acute virus infection was achieved with a phage preparation that displayed a linear epitope. Protection correlated with the presence of sufficient levels of specific antiviral antibodies recognizing the same immunodominant domain and 13-mer peptide, located within the C-terminal S2 subunit, as the selecting mAb. Thus, the direct use of phage-displayed peptides to evaluate protective antiviral immune responses complements their use to characterize antibody-binding epitopes. This is the first evaluation of protective immunization induced by mAb-selected phage-displayed peptides.",
