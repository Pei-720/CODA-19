Staffing shortages, especially of nurses, have been identified as one of the major factors expected to constrain hospitals\u0027 ability to deal with future outbreaks of emerging infections. These problems are compounded by a global nursing shortage. Understanding and improving nurses\u0027 working conditions can potentially decrease the incidence of many infectious diseases. Relevant research is reviewed, and policy options are discussed.",
