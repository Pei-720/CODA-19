Used either in combination with radiography or as a stand-alone imaging modality, ultrasound evaluation of the thoracic and abdominal body cavities is often a high-yield diagnostic undertaking. Many of the conditions that afflict neonatal foals are highly amenable to sonographic interrogation, including pneumonia and other changes in the lungs associated with sepsis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome , multiple organ dysfunction, and prematurity; colic arising from both medical and surgical causes; and urinary tract disorders. Sonographic imaging is not impaired by intracavitary fluid accumulation, and it reveals abnormalities of both soft tissue and bony origin. Adding imaging findings to physical examination and laboratory results aids the veterinarian in detection of intracavitary disease early in evaluation, and this translates into an improved level of both patient care and client care.",
