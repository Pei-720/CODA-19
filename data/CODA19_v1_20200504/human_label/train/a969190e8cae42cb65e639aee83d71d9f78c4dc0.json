The median pig diarrhea dose (PDD 50 ) of the virus pool was determined as 7.35 log 10 PDD 50 /mL, similar to the cell culture infectious titer, 7.75 log 10 plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL. 100 PDD 50 caused watery diarrhea in all conventional suckling piglets (n \u003d 12) derived from a PEDV-naive sow, whereas 1000 and 10 000 PDD 50 did not cause diarrhea in piglets derived from two PEDV-field exposed-recovered sows. This information is important for future PEDV challenge studies and validation of PEDV vaccines.",
