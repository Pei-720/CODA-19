Eukaryotic viruses are known to modulate protein ubiquitination to their advantage in various ways. At the same time, the evidence for the importance of deubiquitination as a viral target also is growing. This review centers on known viral interactions with protein deubiquitination, on viral enzymes for which deubiquitinating activities were recently demonstrated, and on the roles of viral ubiquitin-like sequences.
