The present chapter deals with the role of nanoparticles in modern molecular biology. This is an interesting area of research that creates great impact on the healthcare of the society. The prime focus is to give the reader a historic background of nanomaterial application in biology and medicine. We have also provided the overview of most recent developments in this field leading to discussion of hard road to commercialization.",
