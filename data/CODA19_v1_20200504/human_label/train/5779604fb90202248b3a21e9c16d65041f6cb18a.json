      "original_text": "A coronavirus vector based on the genome of the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) expressing the rotavirus VP7 protein was constructed to immunize and protect against rotavirus infections in a murine model. The tropism of this TGEV-derived vector was modified by replacing the spike S protein with the homologous protein from mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). The rotavirus gene encoding the VP7 protein was cloned into the coronavirus cDNA. BALB/c and STAT1-deficient mice were inoculated with the recombinant viral vector rTGEV S-MHV -VP7, which replicates in the intestine and spreads to other organs such as liver, spleen and lungs. TGEV-specific antibodies were detected in all the inoculated BALB/c mice, while rotavirusspecific antibodies were found only after immunization by the intraperitoneal route. Partial protection against rotavirus-induced diarrhea was achieved in suckling BALB/c mice born to dams immunized with the recombinant virus expressing VP7 when they were orally challenged with the homotypic rotavirus strain.",
