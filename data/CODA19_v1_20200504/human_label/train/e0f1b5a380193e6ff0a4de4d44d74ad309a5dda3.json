Here, we report the structure of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein in complex with its host cell receptor ACE2 revealed by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The complex structure shows that only one receptor-binding domain of the trimeric S glycoprotein binds ACE2 and adopts a protruding \"up\" conformation. In addition, we studied the structures of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein and its complexes with ACE2 in different in vitro conditions, which may mimic different conformational states of the S glycoprotein during virus entry. Disassociation of the S1-ACE2 complex from some of the prefusion spikes was observed and characterized. We also characterized the rosette-like structures of the clustered SARS-CoV S2 trimers in the postfusion state observed on electron micrographs. Structural comparisons suggested that the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein retains a prefusion architecture after trypsin cleavage into the S1 and S2 subunits and acidic pH treatment. However, binding to the receptor opens up the receptor-binding domain of S1, which could promote the release of the S1-ACE2 complex and S1 monomers from the prefusion spike and trigger the pre-to postfusion conformational transition.",

      "original_text": "The spike (S) glycoprotein of the coronavirus is a class I viral fusion protein located on the outer envelope of the virion that plays a critical role in viral infection by recognizing host cell receptors and mediating fusion of the viral and cellular membranes [4] . The coronavirus S glycoprotein is synthesized as a precursor protein consisting of~1,300 amino acids that is then cleaved into an amino (N)-terminal S1 subunit (~700 amino acids) and a carboxyl (C)-terminal S2 subunit (~600 amino acids). Three S1/S2 heterodimers assemble to form a trimer spike protruding from the viral envelope. The S1 subunit contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD), while the S2 subunit contains a hydrophobic fusion peptide and two heptad repeat regions. Triggered by receptor binding, proteolytic processing and/or acidic pH in the cellular compartments, the class I viral fusion protein undergoes a transition from a metastable prefusion state to a stable postfusion state during infection, in which the receptor-binding subunit is cleaved, and the fusion subunit undergoes large-scale conformational rearrangements to expose the hydrophobic fusion peptide, induce the formation of a six-helix bundle, and bring the viral and cellular membranes close for fusion [5] . Coronavirus S glycoprotein features two distinct protease cleavage sites. The S1/S2 cleavage site of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein is located after residue 667 of the precursor protein, whereas the S2\u0027 cleavage site of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein is on the S2 subunit and is 130 amino acids from the N terminus of the S2 subunit [6] [7] [8] . The S1/S2 cleavage site is located in a flexible loop of residues 660-675 that is completely exposed in the prefusion S1-S2 trimer spike. The S2\u0027 cleavage site of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein is highly conserved among coronaviruses and is completely buried in the prefusion SARS-CoV S glycoprotein [6] [7] [8] . Cleavage of the S2\u0027 site by host cell proteases is required for successful infection by 9] . However, the mechanisms involved in exposure and cleavage of the S2\u0027 cleavage site are not well understood. Structural biology studies, especially recent cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies, have advanced our understanding of the role of the coronavirus S glycoprotein in virus entry. S glycoprotein structures in the prefusion state have been reported for members from the Alphacoronavirus genus (HCoV-NL63), Betacoronavirus genus (mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), HKU1, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV), Gammacoronavirus genus (IBV), and Deltacoronavirus genus (PdCoV) [7, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] .
