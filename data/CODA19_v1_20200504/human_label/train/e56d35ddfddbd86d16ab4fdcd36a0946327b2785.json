      "original_text": "The radiolabeled isatin sulfonamide caspase-3 inhibitor, [ 18 F]2 (WC-II-89), is a potential PET radiotracer for noninvasive imaging of apoptosis. The radiolabeling mechanism was studied by 13 C NMR, ESI/MS, and computational calculations. It was found that the high electrophilicity of the C3 carbonyl group in the isatin ring, which served as a trap for [ 18 F]fluoride, was responsible for the failure of the radiolabeling via nucleophilic substitution of the mesylate group in 7a by [ 18 F]fluoride. Once treated with a strong base, 7a opened the isatin ring completely to form an isatinate intermediate 16, which lost the ability to trap [ 18 F]fluoride, thereby allowing the displacement of the mesylate group to afford the 18 F-labeled isatinate 17. [ 18 F]17 can be converted to isatin [ 18 F]2 efficiently under acidic conditions. The ring-opening and re-closure of the isatin ring under basic and acidic conditions were confirmed by reversed phase HPLC analysis, ESI/MS and 13 C NMR studies. Computational studies of model compounds also support the above proposed mechanism. Similarly, the ring-opening and re-closure method was used successfully in the synthesis of the 11 C labeled isatin sulfonamide analogue [ 11 C]4 (WC-98). A microPET imaging study using [ 11 C]4 in the Fas liver apoptosis model demonstrated retained activity in the target organ (liver) of the treated mice. Increased caspase-3 activation in the liver was verified by the fluorometric caspase-3 enzyme assay. Therefore, this study provides a useful method for radiosynthesis of isatin derivative radiotracers for PET and SPECT studies, and [ 11 C]4 is a potential PET radiotracer for noninvasive imaging of apoptosis.",
