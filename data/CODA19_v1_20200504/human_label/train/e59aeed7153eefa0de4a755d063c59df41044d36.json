      "original_text": "The abdominal region is the large part of the body extending from the diaphragm to the pelvis. It includes the abdominal and pelvic cavities, bound by bone and muscle. The peritoneum is the largest and most complexly arranged serous membrane in the body. It forms the lining of the peritoneal cavity, which extends in abdominal cavity and contains the gastrointestinal tract; major abdominal organs, such as the liver, spleen, pancreas, urinary bladder, ovaries, and uterus; and many nerves, vessels, and lymph nodes. The peritoneum extends caudally in the pelvic cavity in males and females (as vaginal tunic and vaginal process, respectively). It is a serous membrane, divided into the parietal peritoneum, which covers the inner surface of the abdominal wall (the abdominal fascia) and the pelvic and scrotal cavities; the visceral peritoneum, which covers the abdominal, pelvic, and scrotal organs; and the connecting peritoneum, which extends between organs or between an organ and the parietal peritoneum, forming peritoneal folders that are divided into mesenteries, omenta, and ligaments. The purpose of the peritoneum is to provide a frictionless surface over which the viscera can move. It also serves as a site of fluid transport. A capillary film of serous fluid separates the parietal and visceral layers of the peritoneum from one another and lubricates the peritoneal surfaces. The retroperitoneal region extends dorsal to the peritoneal and pelvic cavities from the diaphragm to the pelvic inlet. It is bordered dorsally by the vertebrae and paraspinal muscles and laterally by the muscular abdominal and pelvic walls. The kidneys, ureters, and adrenal glands are considered to be retroperitoneal organs. The descending aorta, caudal vena cava, lumbar lymph nodes, cisterna chili, lymphatics, fat, and much of the abdominal wall musculature are also are also located in the",
