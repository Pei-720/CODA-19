      "original_text": "The composition and structure of carbohydrate side chains attached to viral glycoproteins is important for virus maturation. They may influence virus adsorption and penetration, transport of viral glycoproteins [12] , proteolytic cleavage of precursor proteins [1, 7] , association of spike glycoproteins [13] or their antigenicities [5, 11] . With Semliki Forest virus (SFV), a togavirus containing the nucleocapsid protein C and three envelope glycoproteins El, E2 and E3, we previously observed that virus maturation could be inhibited by impairment of glycosylation, e.g. by treatment of infected cells with tunicamycin or 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) [5] . Using polyclonal antisera, we have shown in addition that antigenicities of glycoproteins with no carbohydrate side chains (after treatment with tunicamycin) or with truncated chains (after treatment with 2-DG) differed from those of virus particles [2, 4, 9-]. Using six monoclonal antibodies (mabs) specific for six epitopes a-f on virion E2 we recently found changes in antigenicity of virion E2, if SFV was propagated in cells in presence of N-methyl-l-deoxynojirimycin (MdN): released, infectious virus particles contained mannose-rich carbohydrate side chains of the composition GI%ManT.8,9(GlcNAc)2; epitope d reacted very well, epitopes c and e reacted less, and epitopes a, b and f only very slightly [6, 10-].",
