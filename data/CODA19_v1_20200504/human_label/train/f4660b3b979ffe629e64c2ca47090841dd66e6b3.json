Thus, more than one-third (35%) of all presentations are for digestive diseases. In 2009, in the United States, the cancer statistics revealed 275,720 new cases of GI cancer, with colorectal and pancreatic cancer in the top 10 for both men and women. 2 There were 135,830 deaths due to GI cancer, with colorectal, pancreatic, hepatic, and esophageal cancers in the top 10 for both men and women, except for esophageal cancer, which was only listed for men (Fig. 1) . 2 Furthermore, 2 of these 3 cancers that have an increasing mortality were GI tract cancers for both genders, with esophageal and hepatic cancers among men and pancreatic and hepatic cancers among women. Worldwide the rates of digestive diseases are staggering.",
