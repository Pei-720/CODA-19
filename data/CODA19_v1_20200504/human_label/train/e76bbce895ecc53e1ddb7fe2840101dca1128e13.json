From January to March 2003, faeces from a convenient sample of 879 5-to 30-day-old goat kids from 60 herds were examined microscopically after staining with carbol fuschin. Oocyst shedding was scored semi-quantitatively (0 to 4+) allowing us to obtain a cumulative score per herd. Standardized questionnaires with information about management practices were collected in each farm. We found positive kids in 32 of 60 herds (53.3%) and in 142 animals out of 879 (16.2%). We used logistic regression for two risk-factor model:",
