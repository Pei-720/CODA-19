Results: We present SKEMPI 2.0, a major update to our database of binding free energy changes upon mutation for structurally resolved protein-protein interactions. This version now contains manually curated binding data for 7085 mutations, an increase of 133%, including changes in kinetics for 1844 mutations, enthalpy and entropy changes for 443 mutations, and 440 mutations, which abolish detectable binding.",
