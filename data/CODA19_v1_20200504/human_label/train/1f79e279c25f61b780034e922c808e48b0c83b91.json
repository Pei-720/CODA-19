The frameshift in decoding most vertebrate antizyme mRNAs is stimulated by an RNA pseudoknot 3 0 of the frameshift site. Although the frameshifting event itself is conserved in a wide variety of organisms from yeast to mammals, until recently no corresponding 3 0 RNA pseudoknot was known in invertebrate antizyme mRNAs. A pseudoknot, different in structure and origin from its vertebrate counterparts, is now shown to be encoded by the antizyme genes of distantly related invertebrates. Identification of the 3 0 frameshifting stimulator in intermediate species or other invertebrates remains unresolved.",
