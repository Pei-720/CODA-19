Furthermore, recent advanced systems allow controlled expression of the effector RNA via coexpression of a tetracycline/doxycycline (DOX) responsive repressor (tTR-KRAB). Herein, this system was utilized to assess the antiviral effects of LV-encoded shRNAs targeting three conserved regions on the pregenomic RNA of hepatitis B virus (HBV), namely the region coding for the reverse transcriptase (RT) domain of the viral polymerase (LV-HBV-shRNA1), the core promoter (CP; LV-HBV-shRNA2), and the direct repeat 1 (DR1;",

The corresponding vector was therefore applied in the DOX-controlled system. Notably, strong interference with HBV replication was found in the presence of the inducer DOX whereas the antiviral effect was essentially ablated in its absence; hence, the silencing effect of the shRNA and consequently HBV replication could be strictly regulated by DOX. This newly established system may therefore provide a valuable platform to study the antiviral efficacy of RNA drugs against HBV in a regulated manner, and even be applicable in vivo.",
