He presented to our institution, where he was febrile to 102.7°F with mild meningismus; testicular swelling and tenderness had resolved. The combination of symptoms raised concern for mumps in the setting of a local outbreak, although parotitis was absent. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed 17 total nucleated cells/µL (79% neutrophils, 12% monocytes, 9% lymphocytes), glucose of 65 mg/dL (serum glucose of 109 mg/dL), and total protein of 31 mg/dL. He was treated empirically with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir. Cerebrospinal fluid enterovirus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was positive, antimicrobials were discontinued, and the patient recovered fully. Mumps serology was positive for immunoglobulin (Ig)G and negative for IgM, consistent with his reported history of vaccination. A urine culture for mumps performed by the Massachusetts Department of Health State Laboratory was negative. Cerebrospinal fluid Gram stain and culture were negative, as were CSF herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 PCR, Lyme PCR, and testing for syphilis via the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test. Given the relatively unusual presentation of orchitis and meningitis, we performed metagenomic sequencing to obtain additional genomic information about the particular strain of enterovirus and to identify any potential copathogens including mumps virus.",
