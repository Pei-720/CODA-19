      "original_text": "Nurses are the largest group of healthcare providers and are often the first line responders to a disaster event. Nurses\u0027 disaster competence, motivation for disaster engagement, and factors that impact their motivation to respond to disaster events need to be understood. The purposes of the study were to determine the predictive relationships between Taiwanese nurses\u0027 disaster competence, anticipatory disaster stress, and motivation for disaster engagement. A cross-sectional design was used to analyze data collected between August 2017 and December 2017 from eight hospitals in southern Taiwan. Ninety participants who met the recruitment criteria completed and returned questionnaires with an 88.24% response rate. Data collection involved administering the Disaster Nursing Competence Questionnaire, Anticipatory Disaster Stress Questionnaire, and the Motivation of Disaster Engagement Questionnaire. The results indicated that anticipatory disaster stress was positively correlated with disaster competence and motivation for disaster engagement. Disaster competence and willingness to join a hospital disaster rescue predicts an individuals\u0027 motivation for disaster engagement. The results of the study add to the understanding of factors that correlate with nurses\u0027 motivation to participate in disaster events. By understanding these factors, the government and healthcare administrators can design disaster education plans and other strategies to improve Taiwanese nurses\u0027 motivation to engage in disaster events.",
