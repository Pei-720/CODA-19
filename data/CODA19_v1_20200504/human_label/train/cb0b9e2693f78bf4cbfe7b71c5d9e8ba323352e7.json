      "original_text": "Synthetic decapeptides (N Â¼ 206) covering the entire sequence of mouse liver fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) were used to analyze the specificities of the autoantibodies (autoAb) elicited towards this enzyme in mice infected with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). These autoAb bound mainly to N-and C-terminal FAH peptides, the most reactive sequences being 1e50 and 390e420, respectively. Surprisingly, although FAH sequence 1e50 shares a high degree of homology with various MHV proteins, the C-terminal portion does not. Moreover, whereas the autoAb reacted with homologous peptides surrounding residues 70, 160 and 360, non-similar sequences around residues 130, 210, 240, 250, and 300 were also recognized, indicating that autoAb were not restricted to epitopes with sequence homologies. There was also a lack of correlation between the amount of anti-MHV or anti-FAH antibodies produced and the reactivity towards the peptides. Moreover, the spectrum of peptides recognized by the autoAb of a given mouse did not change significantly with time, which suggests that the MHV-elicited autoimmune response does not induce an epitope recognition spreading. Finally, anti-FAH Ab produced after immunization with rat liver FAH recognized essentially the same mouse FAH regions than autoAb from MHV-infected mice. Results indicated that the induction of the autoAb is not only related to molecular or structural mimicry, but rather supports the Danger model, in which any aggression, in this case the MHV infection, is susceptible to trigger the production of autoAb.",
