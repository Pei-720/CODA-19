We described the viral detection profile and its association with clinical characteristics in children admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) during the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic. Method: Longitudinal observational retrospective study, with patients aged 0-18 years, admitted to 11 PICUs in Rio de Janeiro, with suspected H1N1 infection, from June to November, 2009. The results of respiratory samples which were sent to the Laboratory of Fiocruz/RJ and clinical data extracted from specific forms were analyzed. Results: Of 71 samples, 38% tested positive for H1N1 virus. Of the 63 samples tested for other viruses, 58 were positive: influenza H1N1 (43.1% of positive samples), rhinovirus/enterovirus (41.4%), respiratory syncytial vírus (12.1%), human metapneumovirus (12.1%), adenovirus",
