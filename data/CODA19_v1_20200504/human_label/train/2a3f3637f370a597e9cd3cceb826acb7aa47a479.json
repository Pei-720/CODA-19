We tested wiid-tyl~ baculovirus for endogenous fusion protein activity. Syncytia formation, dye transfer, and capacitance chanses were observed after incubating infected Spodopterafrugiperda cells in acidic media, consistent with fusion protein activity. Only a short acidic pulse of 10 s is needed to trisect syncytia formation. Identical results were obtained with recombinant baculovirus. This new ~ys:e,r~ !,_ convenient for studying pH activated ccll~dl fusion. However, using this enveloped virus to study ~he mechanism of recomlHzant fusion proteins rexluires caution.
