      "original_text": "Picornaviruses include important human pathogens such as human rhinovirus (HRV), enterovirus (EV), coxsackievirus (CV), poliovirus (PV), and hepatitis A virus (HAV). HRVs are the single major cause of the common cold in populations of all ages. 1,2 Although rhinovirus infection is self-limiting, complications still occur in patients with asthma, congestive heart failure, bronchiectasis, and cystic fibrosis. 1 To date, no agent has been approved by the FDA for treatment of rhinovirus infection. In addition, the large number (\u003e100) of known HRV serotypes makes vaccine development difficult. 3 Clinical treatments are directed toward relief of the most prominent symptoms of each clinical syndrome. Previous work on anti-rhinoviral therapeutic agents focused principally on capsid-binding anti-picornaviral compounds 4 and HRV 3C protease (3C pro ) inhibitors. 5, 6 HRV 3C pro is essential for virus replication, specifically catalyzing the cleavage of glutamine-glycine peptide bonds in a 230 kDa viral polyprotein produced by cellular translation of the viral RNA genome. HRV 3C pro belongs to the cysteine protease family, showing structural similarity to trypsin proteases, but sharing minimal homology with common mammalian enzymes. 7,8 Because of the importance of the enzyme in viral replication, and the high conservation of enzyme active site components in all known HRV serotypes, potent and selective HRV 3C pro inhibitors could be potential broad-spectrum anti-rhinoviral therapeutic agents. [9] [10] [11] As part of an effort to develop HRV 3C pro inhibitors, peptidomimetic approaches have been widely employed based on active site structure and cleavage specificity. To date, one peptidomimetic analog, rupintrivir (AG7088) (1), shown in Figure 1 , is the only HRV 3C Pro inhibitor that has advanced to the stage of human clinical trials. Phase II clinical trials of rupintrivir showed that intranasal delivery reduced the mean total daily symptom score by 33%. 12 Recently, several efforts to develop orally bioavailable anti-rhinoviral agents have been reported; these include a rupintrivir analog, 2, 13 with an improved pharmacokinetic profile, and the non-peptidic inhibitors 3 and 4. 14-16",
