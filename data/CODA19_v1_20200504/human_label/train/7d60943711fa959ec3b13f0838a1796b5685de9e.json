      "original_text": "Business integration is an important determinant of business value and firm performance which enables a firm to respond to pressing competitive forces. Given its significant role, business integration in general has been an enduring research topic over the years. However, due to its complex nature, the ways to achieve this important organisational capability in firms are still not clearly understood. Hence, the present study is an attempt to \u0027open this black box\u0027 and examine the relevant issues through a case study of M.com, one of the largest e-commerce firms in China. The findings of this case study emphasise that the ability to coordinate organisational interdependencies and asset orchestration according to the needs of business processes is challenging but necessary in order to achieve business integration in e-commerce firms. It is found that asset orchestration in a firm is contingent on the organisational interdependencies such that different interdependence types demand different coordination methods at the very least. It also shows the significant role of IT in asset orchestration and the coordination of organisational interdependencies during business integration. With these capabilities, firms can experience growth and improve the quality of conformance to customer needs.",
