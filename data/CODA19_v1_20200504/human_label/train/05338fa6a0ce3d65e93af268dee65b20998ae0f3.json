The highest correlation (77% nt and 81.7% aa) was found with feline coronavirus type I. A PCR assay for the S gene of strain Elmo/02 detected analogous CCoVs of different geographic origin, all which exhibited at least 92 Á/96% nucleotide identity to each other and to strain Elmo/02. The evident genetic divergence between the reference CCoV strains and the newly identified Elmo/02-like CCoVs strongly suggests that a novel genotype of CCoV is widespread in the dog population. #",
