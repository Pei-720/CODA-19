In particular, single use disposable N95 face masks have been limited in 34 supply. We have developed an Injection Molded Autoclavable, Scalable, Conformable (iMASC) 35 system for aerosol-based protection. The iMASC system was designed as a reusable liquid 36 silicone rubber mask with disposable N95 filter cartridges that can fit most face sizes and shapes. 37 This system reduced the amount of N95 filter while preserving breathability and fit. Using finite 38 element analysis, we demonstrated mask deformation and reaction forces from facial scans of 39 twenty different wearers. In addition, we validated these findings by successful fit testing in 40 twenty participants in a prospective clinical trial. The iMASC system has the potential to protect 41 our healthcare workers with a reusable N95-comparable face mask that is rapidly scalable. 42 All rights reserved.
