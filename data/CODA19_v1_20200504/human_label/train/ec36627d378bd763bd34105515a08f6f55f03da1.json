      "original_text": "A 7-month-old female intact domestic shorthair/ British Blue crossbreed cat was referred to the Queen Mother Hospital for Animals (QMHA) of the Royal Veterinary College for further investigation of progressive lethargy preceded by 48 hours of mixed bowel diarrhea, moderate pyrexia (39.9°C; 103.8°F), and unproductive retching. Laboratory tests performed at the primary practice identified marked hypercalcemia (serum total calcium concentration). Despite treatment with IV fluids and potentiated amoxicillin, the cat deteriorated clinically, prompting referral. On presentation to the QMHA, the cat was dull but responsive with poor body condition (3.5/9) and pyrexia (39.2°C; 102.6°F). Firm white lingual plaques were observed (Fig 1) . Both kidneys were subjectively mildly enlarged. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable. With the exception of the cat\u0027s decreased mentation, neurologic examination was considered normal. No neurologic deficits suggesting a structural intracranial lesion were found at any point throughout the time the cat was hospitalized, but the level of obtundation would wax and wane. No association between the cat\u0027s mentation and the treatments administered was apparent.",

Plasma ionized calcium concentration gradually decreased from 9.0 mg/dL to 7.44 mg/dL 24 hours after admission, whereas blood urea nitrogen and creatinine concentration increased to 142.6 mg/dL (50.9 mmol/L) and 3.0 mg/dL (268 lmol/L), respectively. The azotemia was believed to be at least partly prerenal, because it gradually resolved over the next 48 hours, with concurrent decreases in packed cell volume and total protein concentration (from 30% and 6.4 g/dL to 20% and 5.4 g/dL, respectively). During the first 3 days of hospitalization, treatment included IV fluid therapy (up to 8 mL/kg/h by the second day), furosemide a (0.5-1.0 mg/kg IV q6h), and salmon calcitonin b (4 IU/kg SC q8h), all of which were initiated on the first day of hospitalization. Furosemide probably contributed to dehydration and development of azotemia, supported by a 100 g (4.8%) decrease in body weight over the first 24 hours. Owing to persistent hypercalcemia despite treatment, IV pamidronate c infusion (1.75 mg/kg diluted in 16 mL 0.9% NaCl, infused at a rate of 4 mL/h) was administered on the third day of hospitalization, at which time salmon calcitonin was discontinued. These treatments failed to substantially alter the plasma ionized calcium concentration, but approximately 48 hours after initiating prednisolone d treatment (0.5 mg/kg PO q12h) on day 6 of hospitalization, plasma ionized calcium con-",
