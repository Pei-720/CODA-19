Type, group, and interspecies specific epitopes were defined. Two group specific MAbs distinguished the enteric TGEV isolates from the respiratory variants. An antigenic subsite involved in neutralization was conserved in porcine, feline, and canine coronavirus. The classification of the human coronavirus 229E in a taxonomic cluster distinct from TGEV group is suggested. o 199o Academic press. I~C.",
