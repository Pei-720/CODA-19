      "original_text": "Avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes considerable damage to the poultry industry worldwide and the proportion of QX-like genotype isolates have increased over time. Here, to better understand the antigenicity and pathogenicity of this genotype, we conducted sequence analyses, cross neutralization tests, and also examined the pathogenicity of two strains, SD and SZ. Sequence analyses revealed that SD and SZ isolates belong to the QX-like IBV genotype and share high homology in their fulllength genomes. Cross neutralization tests showed high cross neutralization between SD and SZ, but distant relationships with other representative strains of the classical IBV serotypes. Virus infection experiments showed that SD caused high mortality with strong respiratory and renal pathogenicity in chickens, whereas SZ caused milder lesions by comparison. This study highlights the big discrepancy in antigenicity that exists between QX-like strains and other serotypes. Collectively, these findings provide important information about the epidemiology and pathogenicity of IBV, which may benefit the control of IB in the poultry industry.",
