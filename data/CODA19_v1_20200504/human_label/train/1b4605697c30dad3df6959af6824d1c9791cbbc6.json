The reasons for this decline are complex and multifaceted. Some of the main factors include WHO\u0027s inability to reform its core structure, the growing influence of non-governmental actors, a lack of coherence in the positions, priorities and funding decisions between the health ministries and the ministries overseeing development assistance in several donor member states, and the lack of strong leadership of the organization.",
