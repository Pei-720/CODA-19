Our aim was to measure students\u0027 anticipated negative emotional responses and avoidance activities (dependent variables) to a possible outbreak of EVD (5). We constructed scales for the dependent and independent variables to assess EVD-related perceptions: 1) misconceptions/knowledge about transmission modes, 2) scenarios of an EVD outbreak in Guangzhou (chances, severity, control), 3) efficacy of preventive measures and self-protection, and 4) public stigma toward EVD survivors. MLwiN 2.30 (Centre for Multilevel Modeling, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK) was used for multilevel regression analyses (online Technical Appendix).",

About half of respondents believed that effective treatment and a vaccine were unavailable (51.9% and 59.1%, respectively); 22.2% anticipated EVD outbreaks among Africans in Guangzhou (during the next 12 months).
