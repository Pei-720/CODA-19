      "original_text": "Turkey coronavirus (TCoV), one of the least characterized of all known coronaviruses, was isolated from an outbreak of acute enteritis in young turkeys in Ontario, Canada, and the full-length genomic sequence was determined. The full-length genome was 27,632 nucleotides plus the 3 poly(A) tail. Two open reading frames, ORFs 1a and 1b, resided in the first two thirds of the genome, and nine additional downstream ORFs were identified. A gene for hemagglutinin-esterase was absent in TCoV. The region between the membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) protein genes contained three potential small ORFs: ORF-X, a previously uncharacterized ORF with an associated putative TRS within the M gene (apparently shared among all group III coronaviruses), and previously described ORFs 5a and 5b. The TCoV genome is organized as follows: 5 UTR -replicase (ORFs 1a, 1b) -spike (S) protein -ORF3 (ORFs 3a, 3b) -small envelop (E or 3c) protein -membrane (M) protein -ORF5 (ORFs X, 5a, 5b) -nucleocapsid (N) protein −3 UTR -poly(A). TCoV genome structure and sequence was most similar, but distinct from, avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). This is the first complete genome sequence for a TCoV and confirms that TCoV belongs to group III coronaviruses.",
