CD8 + DimerX-S1203 + CTLs were detected in the PBMC from these donors up to 3 months after recovery. The percentages of CD8 + DimerX-S1203 + cells paralleled the numbers of interferon-g-positive spots in an ELISPOT assay using the same antigenic peptide. In conclusion, DimerX-based flow cytometry staining may prove to be a real-time method to screen for CTL directed at epitopes from a newly identified virus. D",
