      "original_text": "Efforts to combat HIV, tuberculosis and malaria in sub-Saharan Africa in the past decade have underscored the inadequacy of laboratory systems in most African countries, as they were not equipped to perform vital testing for HIV care and prevention programmes. Laboratory testing is required for the diagnosis and management of these diseases and many other communicable and non-communicable diseases endemic to the African region. For many years, there had been steady neglect of national health laboratories in Africa, leading to a lack of trust in laboratory results and empiric treatment of patients. Early improvement efforts employed a vertical approach, creating national HIV-and AIDS-specific laboratories. This approach has proved inadequate, as it created competition for resources and did not improve the entire laboratory system in the countries. 1 It became clear that all laboratories in a country should be part of a fully-integrated laboratory network that can address both individual patient care needs and public health needs from the peripheral levels to the national level.",
