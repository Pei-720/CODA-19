In PDCoV-inoculated calves, an acute but persisting fecal viral RNA shedding and PDCoV-specific serum IgG antibody responses were observed, but without lesions or clinical disease. However, no fecal shedding, seroconversion, histological lesions, and clinical disease were detected in PEDV-inoculated calves. Our data indicate that calves are susceptible to infection by the newly emerged PDCoV, but not by the swine coronavirus, PEDV.",
