Nonbacterial infectious agents detected by TEM in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serological tests were summarized. The detection rates were further compared between TEM and serological tests. Results: BALF examination under the transmission electron microscope revealed 24 viruses, 16 mycoplasmas, 18 chlamydia, 2 fungi and 74 bacteria in 99 samples, among which 61 samples were mixed infections. The combined use of serological tests and TEM significantly improved the detection rate of nonbacterial infectious agents in patients with severe pneumonia.",
