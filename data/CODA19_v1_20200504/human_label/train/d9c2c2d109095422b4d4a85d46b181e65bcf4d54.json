The piglets were inoculated intratracheally with 10 7.5 50% egg infective dose [EID 50 ] Swine/Belgium/1/98 (H1N1) SIV and were euthanased at time-points between 0 and 120 h post-inoculation (PI). Broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF), lung homogenates and sera were examined for inflammatory mediators by bioassay or ELISA. Interferon (IFN)-a, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a peaked in BALF 24-30 h PI, when virus titres and the severity of clinical signs were maximal.",

The APP C-reactive protein (CRP) and haptoglobin peaked 24 h later than the cytokines and reached higher levels in serum than in BALF. In contrast, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein (LBP) only increased in BALF. Lung virus titres tightly correlated with BALF IFN-a, IL-6, IL-1, TNF-a, IFN-c and IL-12, as well as with serum IL-6, IFN-a and IFN-c. Signs of disease correlated with the same cytokines in BALF and serum, as well as with BALF LBP and serum CRP. The findings suggest that IFN-c and IL-12 play a role in the pathogenesis of SIV and that APPs are induced by cytokines. This influenza infection model may have value in assessing the therapeutic potential of cytokine antagonists.",
