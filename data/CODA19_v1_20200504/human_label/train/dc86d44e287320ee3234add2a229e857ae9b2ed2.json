      "original_text": "Brefeldin A (BFA), a unique fungal metabolite of a 13-membered lactone ring, exhibits various biological actions, including antitumor, antifungal and antiviral activities. In the present study, mouse LB cells were treated with various concentrations of interferon (IFN) and/or BFA overnight and infected with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) after removal of IFN and BFA. Doses of BFA which neither inhibit the metabolism of the cell nor the infectivity of EMCV, decreased the IFN-induced antiviral activity against EMCV as demonstrated by virus titer from supernatants. Since 2-5A synthetase and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase (PKR) have been suggested to be involved in the antiviral action of IFN against EMCV, their activities were investigated in LB cells after BFA treatment. Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization showed a decrease (2-3-fold) in the mRNA of 2\u0027-5\u0027 oligoadenylate (2-5A) synthetase after BFA treatment. BFA also inhibited the activity of 2-5A synthetase, 2-5A dependent RNase i and phosphorylation of PKR in cellular extracts, indicating that BFA may be exerting its inhibitory effect both at theltranscriptional and post-transcriptional levels. This study reports a new biological action of BFA, demonstrating that BFA antagonized the antiviral action of IFN by inhibiting IFN-induced enzymatic pathways. These studies also suggest that both 2-5A and PKR are important in the antiviral activity of IFN against EMCV.",
