Seven effect size metrics were compared for single case design (SCD) data focused on teaching speech generating device use to individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) with moderate to profound levels of impairment. The effect size metrics included percent of data points exceeding the median (PEM), percent of nonoverlapping data (PND), improvement rate difference (IRD), percent of all nonoverlapping data (PAND), Phi, nonoverlap of all pairs (NAP), and Tau novlap . Results showed that among the seven effect size metrics, PAND, Phi, IRD, and PND were more effective in quantifying intervention effects for the data sample (N \u003d 285 phase or condition contrasts). Results are discussed with respect to issues concerning extracting and calculating effect sizes, visual analysis, and SCD intervention research in IDD.",

This has resulted in a preponderance of single case design (SCD) studies for which there is not a standard effect size metric. In this article, we used the results from SCD SGD intervention studies as a vehicle to further evaluate different non-parametric effect size metrics from SCD studies. Our rationale was, in part, pragmatic. That is, the literature specific to SGD and severe disabilities is a manageable literature. Additionally, SGDs represent an area of a relatively rapid growth with tablet-based systems emerging and proliferating (Kuster, 2012; McNaughton \u0026 Light, 2013) . In the following sections we provide a brief overview of the literature addressing SGD and SCD. Subsequently, we provide a rationale for the SCD effect size comparisons that were conducted.",
