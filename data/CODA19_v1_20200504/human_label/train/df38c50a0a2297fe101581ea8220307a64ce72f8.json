Seroresponses to VP7 and VP4, as determined by a 4-fold or greater antibody response, were not always elicited concurrently following infection: in some calves, (i) seroresponses to VP7 were detected earlier than to VP4 or vice versa; and (ii) a subsequent 2 nd seroresponse was detected for VP7 or VP4 only. In addition, a second infection was more likely to be caused by different G and/or P types. Analyses of serum samples showed that the most frequent G-P combination was G8P6[1] followed by G8P7[5], G8P8[11] and G6P6[1].",
