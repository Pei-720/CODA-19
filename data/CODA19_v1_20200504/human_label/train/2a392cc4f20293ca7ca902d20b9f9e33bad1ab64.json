      "original_text": "Feline coronaviruses are widespread and come in different flavors. There are two main serotypes both of which occur in two pathotypes, the avirulent enteric viruses and the virulent, usually fatal peritonitis viruses, the latter in turn occurring either in a`wet\u0027 or exudative form or in a`dry\u0027 or proliferative form. In this paper a concise overview is given of the molecular features of these viruses. Special attention is given to the genetic dynamics of the viruses as these now allow us to begin to understand the origin of the different phenotypes, in particular the genesis of virulence during persistent infection. As discussed, the surprising new insights obtained over the last few years call for a critical reevaluation of strategies for protection. #",
