Based on sequence heterogeneity, PED viruses are tentatively categorized as \"classical\" and \"emerging\" strains. The classical strains include PED viruses identified between 1970s to 2010, whereas PED viruses isolated after 2010 are referred to as emerging strains. The emerging strains are further divided into \"non-S INDEL (insertions and deletions)\" and \"S INDEL\" strains on the basis of the spike (S) protein sequences and virulence in piglets. Another proposal classifies PED viruses into up to five genotypes.",
