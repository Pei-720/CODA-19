      "original_text": "To study the host-dependent genetic variations in murine hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV 3) induced diseases, we localized the sites of MHV 3 (Mill Hill strain) expression within liver and brain by immunohistochemistry or hybridization in situ. Two strains of mice were studied: BALB/c mice, which develop an acute and lethal hepatitis and C3H mice which develop a chronic brain infection. In BALB/c mice, viral RNA and antigens appeared during the first 24 h post infection (p.i.) in liver, whereas viral RNA was barely detectable in brain, up until death at day 3 p.i. In C3H mice, viral RNA and antigens were detected simultaneously in liver and brain only at day 2 p.i. In brain, the virus was detected in meningeal and ependymal cells and in perivascular cortical areas (days 5 and 7 p.i.). After day 49, the virus was no longer detected in brain parenchyma, but persisted in meningeal cells. Two host-dependent genetic differences in viral processing were observed in the liver: (1) the virus was first detected in Kupffer cells in BALB/c mice and mostly in hepatocytes in C3H mice; (2) in BALB/c mice, the 180kDa S viral glycoprotein appeared more frequently cleaved in 90 kDa form than in C3H mice.",
