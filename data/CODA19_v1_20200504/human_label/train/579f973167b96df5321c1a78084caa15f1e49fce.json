      "original_text": "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is a cause of hepatitis in humans worldwide and has been associated with a mortality rate of up to 30% in pregnant women. Recently, persistent and chronic HEV infections have been recognized as a serious clinical problem, especially in immunocompromised individuals. To date, there are no FDA-approved HEV-specific antiviral drugs. In this study, we evaluated antisense peptide-conjugated morpholino oligomers (PPMO) designed against HEV genomic sequences as potential HEV-specific antiviral compounds. Two genetically-distinct strains of human HEV, genotype 1 Sar55 and genotype 3 Kernow-C1, isolated from patients with acute and chronic hepatitis, respectively, were used to evaluate inhibition of viral replication by PPMO in liver cells. The anti-HEV PPMO produced a significant reduction in the levels of HEV RNA and capsid protein, indicating effective inhibition of HEV replication. PPMO HP1, which targets a highly conserved sequence in the start site region of ORF1, was also effective against the genotype 3 Kernow-C1 strain in stably-infected HepG2/C3A liver cells. The antiviral activity observed was specific, dose-responsive and potent, suggesting that further exploration of PPMO HP1 as a potential HEV-specific antiviral agent is warranted.",
