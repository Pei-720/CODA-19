      "original_text": "Semliki Forest virus (SFV) is an arthropod-borne alphavirus that induces membrane invaginations (spherules) in host cells. These harbor the viral replication complexes (RC) that synthesize viral RNA. Alphaviruses have four replicase or nonstructural proteins (nsPs), nsP1-4, expressed as polyprotein P1234. An early RC, which synthesizes minus-strand RNA, is formed by the polyprotein P123 and the polymerase nsP4. Further proteolytic cleavage results in a late RC consisting of nsP1-4 and synthesizing plus strands. Here, we show that only the late RCs are highly active in RNA synthesis in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrate that active RCs can be isolated from both virus-infected cells and cells transfected with the wild-type replicase in combination with a plasmid expressing a template RNA. When an uncleavable polyprotein P123 and polymerase nsP4 were expressed together with a template, high levels of minus-strand RNA were produced in cells, but RCs isolated from these cells were hardly active in vitro. Furthermore, we observed that the uncleavable polyprotein P123 and polymerase nsP4, which have previously been shown to form spherules even in the absence of the template, did not replicate an exogenous template. Consequently, we hypothesize that the replicase proteins were sequestered in spherules and were no longer able to recruit a template. Viruses 2017, 9, 292 2 of 18 polymerase [9-16]. All members of the alphavirus-like superfamily share capping, helicase, and polymerase domains in their replicase proteins [2].",

The replicase proteins are expressed from one or several plasmids together with a separate plasmid that expresses a template RNA that can be replicated in trans. However, active replication is achieved only when plus-stranded RNA is expressed as a template. This indicates that replication cannot initiate from a single-stranded minus strand as a template, but rather requires a dsRNA intermediate for plus-strand synthesis [27, 30] . Furthermore, it has been recently shown that a partially uncleaved alphavirus replicase can form spherules in the absence of the RNA template [29] . The template-independent spherule formation requires a combination of the uncleaved P123 and nsP4 or nsP1, or uncleaved P23 and nsP4. Furthermore, even a polymerase mutant (nsP4 GAA ) with its active site Gly-Asp-Asp (GDD) mutated to Gly-Ala-Ala (GAA) causes spherule formation when co-expressed with P123 or nsP1 and P23. Spherule morphology in the absence of the template is, however, more irregular compared to those formed during normal replication, confirming the idea that the template plays a central role in size determination.",
