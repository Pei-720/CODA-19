The aim of this study was to evaluate the immune cross-reactivity between human and avian infl uenza (H5N1) strains in healthy donors vaccinated for seasonal infl uenza A (H1N1)/(H3N2). A small frequency of CD4 T cells specifi c for subtype H5N1 was detected in several persons at baseline, and seasonal vaccine administration enhanced the frequency of such reactive CD4 T cells. We also observed that seasonal vaccination is able to raise neutralizing immunity against infl uenza (H5N1) in a large number of donors. No correlation between infl uenzaspecifi c CD4 T cells and humoral responses was observed. N1 may possibly be a target for both cellular and humoral cross-type immunity, but additional experiments are needed to clarify this point. These fi ndings highlight the possibility of boosting cross-type cellular and humoral immunity against highly pathogenic avian infl uenza A virus subtype H5N1 by seasonal infl uenza vaccination.",
