      "original_text": "Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is the main cause of severe respiratory illness in young children and elderly people. We investigated the genetic characteristics of the circulating HRSV subgroup A (HRSV-A) to determine the distribution of genotype ON1, which has a 72-nucleotide duplication in attachment G gene. We obtained 456 HRSV-A positive samples between October 2008 and February 2013, which were subjected to sequence analysis. The first ON1 genotype was discovered in August 2011 and 273 samples were identified as ON1 up to February 2013. The prevalence of the ON1 genotype increased rapidly from 17.4% in 2011-2012 to 94.6% in 2012-2013. The mean evolutionary rate of G protein was calculated as 3.275 Â 10 À3 nucleotide substitution/site/year and several positively selected sites for amino acid substitutions were located in the predicted epitope region. This basic and important information may facilitate a better understanding of HRSV epidemiology and evolution.",
