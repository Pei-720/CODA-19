      "original_text": "This chapter is focused on the development and use of acoustic wave biosensor platforms for the detection of bacteria, specifically those based on the thickness shear mode (TSM) resonator. We demonstrated the mechanical and electrical implications of bacterial positioning at the solid-liquid interface of a TSM biosensor and presented a model of the TSM with bacteria attached operating as coupled oscillators. The experiments and model provide an understanding of the nature of the signals produced by acoustic wave devices when they are used for testing bacteria. The paradox of \"negative mass\" could be a real threat to the interpretation of experimental results related to the detection of bacteria. The knowledge of the true nature of \"negative mass\" linked to the strength of bacteria attachment will contribute significantly to our understanding of the results of \"weighing bacteria.\" The results of this work can be used for bacterial detection and control of processes of bacterial settlement, bacterial colonization, biofilm formation, and bacterial infection in which bacterial attachment plays a role.",
