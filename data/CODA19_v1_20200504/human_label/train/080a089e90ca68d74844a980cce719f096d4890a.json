      "original_text": "Veal calf hemorrhagic enteritis, a condition that has no identified specific etiology, is a fatal syndrome of veal calves and has recently become a major concern of the veal calf industry in the midwestern United States. To determine the possible role of common enteric pathogens in this disease, 40 veal calves with hemorrhagic enteritis (cases) and 25 dairy calves diagnosed with enteric infection (control) were investigated. The veal calves were negative for several known enteric pathogens except for pathogenic Escherichia coil isolates that expressed multiple virulence attributes. To determine whether such isolates have a significant association with hemorrhagic enteritis in veal calves, we compared the prevalence of pathogenic E. coli in the 40 veal calves with the prevalence of similar E. coil in the dairy calves that were diagnosed with colibacillosis within the same season of the year. Escherichia coil isolates from the two groups of calves were tested for several properties orE. coil related to pathogenicity, i.e. production of verotoxins, heat-stable enterotoxin (STa), heat-labile enterotoxin, enterohemolysin, K99 fimbrial antigens, hemagglutination activity, and attachment to Hep-2 tissue culture cells. Escherichia coil that produce ST a were more commonly isolated from veal calves with hemorrhagic enteritis (45%) than from dairy calves with enteritis (12%) ( P \u003c 0.05 ). Various patterns of attachment of E. coil to Hep-2 tissue culture cells were studied. The E. coil that demonstrated aggregative patterns of attachment were more commonly represented in veal calves (32%) than in dairy calves (8%). We observed that there was no correlation between STa production and K99 pill expression among the enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) isolates that were recovered from veal calves.",
