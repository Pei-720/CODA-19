      "original_text": "We developed a novel concept that allows to considerably improve the performance of conventionally used ÿltering-facepiece respirators against ÿne and ultraÿne aerosols including airborne viral and bacterial agents. The concept is based on the continuous emission of unipolar ions. The e ect was evaluated through the real-time monitoring of the concentration and size distribution of ÿne and ultraÿne aerosol particles. The measurements were conducted inside and outside of a respiratory mask that was face sealed on a breathing manikin. A commonly used Type N95 respirator and surgical mask were utilized for the tests. The manikin was placed in a 24.3-m 3 indoor test chamber and exposed to polydisperse surrogate aerosols simulating viral and bacterial particles with respect to the aerodynamic size. The particle penetration through the mask was found to decrease by one-to-two orders of magnitude as a result of continuous unipolar ion emission in the chamber. The ux of air ions migrated to the breathing zone and imparted electrical charges of the same polarity to the aerosol particles and the respirator ÿlter surface. This created an electrostatic shield along the external surface of the ÿlter, thus enhancing the protection characteristics provided by the respirator. The above performance enhancement e ect is crucial for minimizing the infectious risk in the cases when the conventional ÿltering-facepiece respirators are not able to provide an adequate protection against airborne viruses and bacteria. ?",
