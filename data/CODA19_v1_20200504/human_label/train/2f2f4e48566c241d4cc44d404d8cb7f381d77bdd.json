Viral infection was detected in the cytoplasm of chicken embryo kidney cells inoculated with Mass41, Ark99, SE17 or two recent field isolates of IBV using in situ cytohybridization and a biotinylated probe. In vivo infections were detected in individual cells of tracheas and lungs 2,4, and 6 days after inoculation of chicks with Mass41 and Ark99. In situ hybridization of Ark99 infected tissue sections using 32p-dATP labelled probe indicated that more viral replication was present in the trachea on day 4 than either days 2 or 6; whereas more viral RNA was found in the lungs on day 6 than days 2 or 4 after inoculation.",
