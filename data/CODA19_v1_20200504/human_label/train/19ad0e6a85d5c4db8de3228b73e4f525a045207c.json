Microchip capillary electrophoresis (CE) has the potential to achieve very rapid analysis (typically seconds), easy integration of multiple analytical steps, and parallel operation. Although it is currently still in an early stage of development, there are already many reports in the literature describing the applications of microchip CE in clinical analysis. At the same time, more fully automated and higher throughput commercial instruments for microchip CE are becoming available and are expected to further enhance the development of applications of microchip CE in routine clinical testing. To put into perspective its potential, we briefly compare microchip CE with conventional CE and review developments in this technique that may be useful in diagnosis of major diseases.",

We present an overview of the approaches and selected applications of microchip CE devices in the diagnosis of major diseases, including cancer (33-41 ); cardiovascular (42-45 ), renal (46, 47 ), neurologic (48 -50 ), thyroid (51, 52 ), and infectious diseases (53-64 ); immune disorders (65-69 ); diabetes (70 -72 ); and hereditary diseases (73-77 ).
