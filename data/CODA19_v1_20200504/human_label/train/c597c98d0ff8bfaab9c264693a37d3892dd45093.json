      "original_text": "Alphaviruses were amongst the first arboviruses to be isolated, characterized and assigned a taxonomic status. They are globally widespread, infecting a large variety of terrestrial animals, birds, insects and even fish. Moreover, they are capable of surviving and circulating in both sylvatic and urban environments, causing considerable human morbidity and mortality. The re-emergence of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in almost every part of the world has caused alarm to many health agencies throughout the world. The mosquito vector for this virus, Aedes, is globally distributed in tropical and temperate regions and capable of thriving in both rural and urban landscapes, giving the opportunity for CHIKV to continue expanding into new geographical regions. Despite the importance of alphaviruses as human pathogens, there is currently no targeted antiviral treatment available for alphavirus infection. This mini-review discusses some of the major features in the replication cycle of alphaviruses, highlighting the key viral targets and host components that participate in alphavirus replication and the molecular functions that were used in drug design. Together with describing the importance of these targets, we review the various direct-acting and host-targeting inhibitors, specifically small molecules that have been discovered and developed as potential therapeutics as well as their reported in vitro and in vivo efficacies.",
