Primer extension experiments showed that the RNA expressing this gene is shorter than the complete ORF, and could form a protein of M r 85 540. The protein was expressed by recombinant baculovirus and was recognized by anti-virion serum, indicating a structural role. Sequence comparison indicates that astrovirus serotypes 1 and 2 differ markedly in the C-terminal half of the protein but are well conserved towards the N-terminus.",
