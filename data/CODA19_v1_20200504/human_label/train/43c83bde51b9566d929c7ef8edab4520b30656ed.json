      "original_text": "White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is a major shrimp viral pathogen responsible for large economic losses to shrimp aquaculture all over the world. The RNAi mediated by siRNA contributes a new strategy to control this viral disease. However, the efficient approach to deliver the siRNA into shrimp remains to be addressed. In this investigation, an antiviral vp28-siRNA was encapsulated in β-1,3-D-glucan, and then the β-1,3-D-glucan-encapsulated vp28-siRNA particles (GeRPs) were delivered into Marsupenaeus japonicus shrimp. The results showed that the vp28-siRNA in GeRPs could be released in hemocytes of shrimp. It was found that the GeRPs containing the vp28-siRNA inhibited the replication of WSSV in vivo, which presented a better antiviral activity than the non-encapsulated vp28-siRNA. Further evidence indicated that the mortality of WSSV-infected shrimp was significantly delayed by the GeRPs containing vp28-siRNA. Therefore, our study presented that the glucan-encapsulated siRNA might represent a novel potential therapeutic or preventive approach to control the shrimp disease.",
