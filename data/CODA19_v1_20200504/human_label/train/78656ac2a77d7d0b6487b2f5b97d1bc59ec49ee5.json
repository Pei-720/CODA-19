They encode a wide spectrum of multifunctional proteins, which interplay with and modify proteins in host cells. Viral genomes were chronologically the first to be sequenced. However, the corresponding viral proteomes, the alterations of host proteomes upon viral infection, and the dynamic nature of proteins, such as post-translational modifications, enzymatic cleavage, and activation or destruction by proteolysis, remain largely unknown. Emerging high-throughput techniques, in particular quantitative or semi-quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis of viral and cellular proteomes, have been applied to define viruses and their interactions with their hosts. Here, we review the major areas of viral proteomics, including virion proteomics, structural proteomics, viral protein interactomics, and changes to the host cell proteome upon viral infection.",
