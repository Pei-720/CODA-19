Few policy diffusion studies have examined use of information, such as cost-benefıt analyses, in the diffusion process. The purpose of this study is to examine how cost-benefıt analyses were used during the rapid diffusion of 2-1-1 across states. The paper also describes components of 2-1-1 cost-benefıt analyses.",
