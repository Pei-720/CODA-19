      "original_text": "A prospective stud)! was carried out to determine the epidemiology and etiology of acute gastroenteritis on the general infant ward oj The Montreal Children\u0027s Hospital in the late fall of /976. Diarrhea occurred in 4/ of /65 infants (25%), with probable nosocomial acquisition in 26 patients. Two infants each had two episodes of diarrhea. and one had three. A putative pathogen was found In 3/ of 45 case episodes (69%). Virus-like particles were present in 28 o] 45 patients, and in 24 of 74 asymptomatic room contacts. Particles belonging to six morphologic classes were identified: adenovirus. rota virus, minirotavlrus, calicivirus, plcorna-parvovirus, and coronavirus. More than one agent was identified in /2 infants with diarrhea and in five asymptomatic room contacts. No wardwide etiologic pal/ern was evident, but minirotavirus or caltcivirus or both were associated with diarrhea in 10 patients, accompanied by vomiting in /5 of these infants. Moreover, spread oj individual agents was almost entirely limited to minirotavirus and calicivirus, with diarrhea in six of ten. and four of seven, virus positive room contacts. respectively. These viruses were also identified in stools from 12 infants without diarrhea, seven oJ whom had repeated vomiting. Data support the etiologic role oj mlnirotavirus and calicivirus in diarrhea or vomiting or both in hospitalized infants.",
