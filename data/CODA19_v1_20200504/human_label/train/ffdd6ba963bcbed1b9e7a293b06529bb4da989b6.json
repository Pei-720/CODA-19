      "original_text": "Comparing sequences of archived viruses collected over many years to the present allows the study of viral evolution and contributes to the design of new vaccines. However, the difficulty, time and expense of generating full-length sequences individually from each archived sample have hampered these studies. Next generation sequencing technologies have been utilized for analysis of clinical and environmental samples to identify viral pathogens that may be present. This has led to the discovery of many new, uncharacterized viruses from a number of viral families. Use of these sequencing technologies would be advantageous in examining viral evolution. In this study, a sequencing procedure was used to sequence simultaneously and rapidly multiple archived samples using a single standard protocol. This procedure utilized primers composed of 20 bases of known sequence with 8 random bases at the 3 -end that also served as an identifying barcode that allowed the differentiation each viral library following pooling and sequencing. This conferred sequence independence by random priming both first and second strand cDNA synthesis. Viral stocks were treated with a nuclease cocktail to reduce the presence of host nucleic acids. Viral RNA was extracted, followed by single tube random-primed double-stranded cDNA synthesis. The resultant cDNAs were amplified by primer-specific PCR, pooled, size fractionated and sequenced on the Ion Torrent PGM platform. The individual virus genomes were readily assembled by both de novo and template-assisted assembly methods. This procedure consistently resulted in near full length, if not full-length, genomic sequences and was used to sequence multiple bovine pestivirus and coronavirus isolates simultaneously.",
