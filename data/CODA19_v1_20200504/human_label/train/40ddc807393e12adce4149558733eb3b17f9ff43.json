The first one is responsible for secretion of many of the aqueous components of milk including casein, a-lactalbumin, and lactose. Caseins, after translation, are transferred to the Golgi apparatus, where they are phosphorylated or glycosylated. As these proteins pass from the terminal cisternae of the Golgi compartment into secretory vesicles, their concentration increases to the millimolar range, causing aggregation of the casein molecules into micelles (Morr et al., 1971) . The secretory vesicles migrate to the apical membrane, fuse with it, and release their contents by exocytosis. One prominent milk protein, á-lactalbumin, forms a complex with the enzyme galactosyltransferase in the Golgi, where the complex catalyze the synthesis of lactose. The osmotic activity of this disaccharide draws water and presumably ions into the Golgi, providing the driving force for fluid secretion.",
