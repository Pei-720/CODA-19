Experimental results showed no significant difference in viable removal efficiency and pressure drop between the treated and untreated filters for polypropylene filtering facepiece respirators. The pressure drop of DAS treated cellulose filters significantly decreased although there was no significant change in viable removal efficiency; the combination of these two factors resulted in an increase of filter quality. All biocidal filters showed a significantly lower relative survivability than untreated filters, and the relative survivability decreased as the concentration of DAS increased. The biocidal filter treated with 4% DAS presented an average of 30% survivability compared to the baseline of untreated filters. The results demonstrate that dialdehyde starch can be incorporated onto filters to provide an effective means for inactivating MS2 viruses through surface contact.",
