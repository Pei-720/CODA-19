Human rhinovirus was the most common virus detected in 97 (62%) and 24 (65%) patients with URTI and LRTI, respectively. Leukemia or lymphoma (LL) was the most common underlying diagnosis in 95 (49%) patients followed by solid tumor 47 (24%), posthematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) 28 (15%), and brain tumor in 23 (12%) patients. By multiple logistic regression analysis hBoV was the most commonly detected respiratory virus in patients with LRTI (P \u003d 0.008; odds ratio, 4.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.48-13.79). Coinfection with more than 1 virus was present in 47 (24%) patients, and did not increase the risk for LRTI. Two (0.7%) patients succumbed to LRTI from parainfluenza virus (PIV)-3 and respiratory syncytial virus/HRV infection, respectively. C.pneumoniae and M.pneumoniae were detected in 4 and 3 patients, respectively.",
