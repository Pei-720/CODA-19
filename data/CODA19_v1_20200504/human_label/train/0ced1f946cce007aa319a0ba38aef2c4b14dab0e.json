Four of eight candidate peptides were tested by HLA-A*0201 binding assays. Among the four candidate peptides, Sp8 (S 958-966 , VLNDILSRL) induced specific CTLs both ex vivo in PBLs of healthy HLA-A2 + donors and in HLA-A2.1/K b transgenic mice immunized with a plasmid encoding full-length S protein. The immunized mice released IFN-γ and lysed target cells upon stimulation with Sp8 peptide-pulsed autologous dendritic cells in comparison to other candidates.",
