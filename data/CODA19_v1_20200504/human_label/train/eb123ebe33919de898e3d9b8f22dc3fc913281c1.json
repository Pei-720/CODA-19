However, there was lack of pharmacokinetic information of chrysoeriol and diosmetin after oral administration of Flos Keywords: Chrysanthemi extract (FCE). The present study aimed to develop an HPLC-UV method for Luteolin simultaneous determination of rat plasma concentration of luteolin, apigenin, chrysoeriol and Chrysoeriol diosmetin and utilize it in pharmacokinetic study of the four compounds after orally giving FCE to Diosmetin rats. The method was successfully validated and applied to the pharmacokinetic study when oral Pharmacokinetics administration of FCE to rats with or without co-giving a COMT inhibitor, entacapone. Chrysoeriol Flos Chrysanthemi and diosmetin were detected in rat plasma after oral administration of FCE and their Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)",
