      "original_text": "Background: Up to date, there have been no studies to evaluate pilgrims\u0027 knowledge, attitude and practices regarding MERS-CoV during the annual Hajj pilgrimage in order to see whether there is a need for these aspects to be improved. Methods: A cross-sectional survey study was conducted with a convenience sampling. Participants were pilgrims, aged over 18, and able to speak Arabic or English. A self-administered structured questionnaire was distributed during Hajj season in Mecca. Descriptive and multiple linear regression analysis were used in data analysis. Results: Two hundred and fifty-seven participants completed the study, 80% of whom were female, and the median (IQR) age was 35 (24.5e43.5) years. Pilgrims had moderately correct knowledge and accurate attitudes about MERS-CoV with median scores of 5 (IQR 4e7) and 6 (IQR: 5e7) respectively. Educational level and employment status were significantly associated with knowledge whereas gender and age were significantly associated with attitude and practices respectively (P \u003c 0.05). The correlation between knowledge, attitude and practices was significant (correlation coefficient: 0.207; P \u003c 0.05). Better knowledge was found to be a predictor for positive practice. Conclusions: These findings will provide insight when designing future interventions to promote specific messages to enhance knowledge, change attitude and improve practice regarding MERS-CoV.",
