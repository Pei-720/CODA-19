      "original_text": "White matter disease afflicts both developing and mature central nervous systems. Both cell intrinsic and extrinsic dysregulation result in profound changes in cell survival, axonal metabolism and functional performance. Experimental models of developmental white matter (WM) injury and demyelination have not only delineated mechanisms of signaling and inflammation, but have also paved the way for the discovery of pharmacological approaches to intervention. These reagents have been shown to enhance protection of the mature oligodendrocyte cell, accelerate progenitor cell recruitment and/or differentiation, or attenuate pathological stimuli arising from the inflammatory response to injury. Here we highlight reports of studies in the CNS in which compounds, namely peptides, hormones, and small molecule agonists/antagonists, have been used in experimental animal models of demyelination and neonatal brain injury that affect aspects of excitotoxicity, oligodendrocyte development and survival, and progenitor cell function, and which have been demonstrated to attenuate damage and improve WM protection in experimental models of injury. The molecular targets of these agents include growth factor and neurotransmitter receptors, morphogens and their signaling components, nuclear receptors, as well as the processes of iron transport and actin binding. By surveying the current evidence in non-immune targets of both the immature and mature WM, we aim to better understand pharmacological approaches modulating endogenous oligodendroglia that show potential for success in the contexts of developmental and adult WM pathology.",
