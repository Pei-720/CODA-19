STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study of 111 infants born o29 weeks GA, controlling for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) severity and assessing pulmonary health over the first year of life through oxygen, diuretic and inhaled steroid use. RESULT: Regression analysis showed viral infections increased oxygen use (odds ratio (OR) of 15.5 (confidence interval (CI) ¼ 3.4, 71.3)). The trend test showed increasing numbers of viral infections were associated with increased oxygen (OR (95% CI) ¼ 6.4 (2.3 to 17.4), P ¼ 0.0003), diuretic (OR (95% CI) ¼ 2.4 (1.1to 5.2), P ¼ 0.02) and inhaled steroid use (OR (95% CI) ¼ 2.2 (1.003 to 5.2), P ¼ 0.049), whereas bacterial infections were not. CONCLUSION: Viral infections caused more long-term pulmonary morbidity/mortality than bacterial infections on premature lung health, even when controlling for BPD.",
