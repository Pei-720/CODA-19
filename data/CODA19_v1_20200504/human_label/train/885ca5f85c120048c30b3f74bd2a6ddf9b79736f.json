Viral co-infections were found in 117 children (19AE7% of the enrolled children; 26AE9% of those with viral infections). Marginal differences were found between the infections owing to a single virus. Co-infections showed radiographic evidence of alveolar pneumonia significantly more frequently than single infections (OR 1AE72, 95% CI 1AE05-2AE81).",
