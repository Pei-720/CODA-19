      "original_text": "The interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) are a family of small transmembrane proteins belonging to the interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene (ISG) superfamily and strongly induced by IFNs. In this paper, we studied the expression profile of IFITMs in 32 organ tissues. The IFITM mRNA expression profile showed that IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 were expressed in each tissue, especially, in spermatophore, spermaduct, testicle and epididymis. The expression of IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 showed a trend from high to low. Except for IFITM3 and IFITM6, the others IFITMs were highly expressed in the bone marrow, and the expression level of them was higher in the tibia than that in other parts of the long bones. In liver, the relative expression of IFITM1 and IFITM3 was higher than that of other members. The expression level of IFITM5 was the highest in bone marrow, successively in pancreas, and it was low in skin, smooth muscle and fat. Interestingly, the expression profile of IFITM2 and IFITM7 in tissues was similar to IFITM5. The expression of IFITM2, IFITM5 and IFITM10 were higher in smooth muscle than that in skeletal muscle. IFITM2, IFITM5, IFITM7 and IFITM10 were both highly expressed in esophagus and trachea. In addition, the expression of IFITM6 in eyes was high, and also in pancreas, gallbladder and bone. In the present study, we systematically analyzed the mRNA expression profile of IFITMs in 32 organ tissues, providing the foundation for the study of the function of the IFITMs.",
