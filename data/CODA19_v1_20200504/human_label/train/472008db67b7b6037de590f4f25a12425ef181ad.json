In experiments in vitro, three human APOBEC3 proteins (A3C, A3F and A3H) inhibited HCoV-NL63 infection and limited production of progeny virus, but did not cause hypermutation of the coronaviral genome. APOBEC3-mediated restriction was partially dependent on enzyme activity, and was reduced by the use of enzymatically inactive APOBEC3. Moreover, APOBEC3 proteins bound to the coronaviral nucleoprotein, and this interaction also affected viral replication. Although the precise molecular mechanism of deaminasedependent inhibition of coronavirus replication remains elusive, our results further our understanding of APOBEC-mediated restriction of RNA virus infections.",

Its function as an antiviral factor was discovered in 2002 through cDNA-transfer experiments that were designed to identify a cellular suppressor of an HIV-1 accessory protein, the virion infectivity factor (Vif). The primary antiretroviral activity of A3G requires its encapsidation into HIV-1 particles, and involves cytidine deamination of the reverse-transcribed first viral DNA strand, with mutations becoming fixed as G to A changes upon second-strand synthesis. Mutational frequencies can exceed 10% of all G residues (hypermutation), and may result in inhibition of viral replication.
