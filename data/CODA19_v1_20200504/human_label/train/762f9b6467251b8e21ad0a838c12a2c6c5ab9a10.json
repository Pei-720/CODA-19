IBV nsp2 is one of the first replicase proteins to be translated and processed in the viral life cycle; however, it has an entirely unknown function. In order to better understand the structural details and functional mechanism of IBV nsp2, the recombinant protein was cloned, overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified and crystallized. The crystals diffracted to 2.8 Å resolution and belonged to space group P2 1 , with unit-cell parameters a \u003d 57.0, b \u003d 192.3, c \u003d 105.7 Å , \u003d 90.8 . Two molecules were found in the asymmetric unit; the Matthews coefficient was 3.9 Å 3 Da À1 , corresponding to a solvent content of 68.2%.",
