Through yielding powerful insights into the past, the Tree of Life provides a means to interpret the patterns and processes of evolution, as well as the ability to predict the responses of life in the face of rapid environmental change. Broad knowledge of species relationships is fundamental, providing crucial new information regarding the discovery of medicines, combatting diseases, and crop improvement. This information has also had major impacts in the diverse fields of genomics, evolution, and development, while providing insights into the study of adaptation, speciation, community assembly, and ecosystem functioning. Given the many benefits, it is therefore hard to summarize, in a few words, the immense implications and applications of the Tree of Life to biology and human well-being.",
