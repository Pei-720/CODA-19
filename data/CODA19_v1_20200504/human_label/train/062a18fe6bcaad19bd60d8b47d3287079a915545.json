Renal insufficiency developed more frequently in critically ill patients (P \u003d 0.023). The duration of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) therapy was longer in recovered patients than in critically ill patients (P \u003d 0.01). Laboratory tests showed that levels of C-reactive protein, serum creatinine, and myoglobin were significantly higher in critically ill patients than in recovered patients (P \u003d 0.011, 0.04, and 0.016, respectively). Meanwhile, levels of all T cell subsets examined including total CD3 + , CD4 + , CD8 + , and CD45 + T cells were lower in critically ill patients than in recovered patients (P \u003d 0.033, 0.059, 0.015, and 0.039, respectively). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that C-reactive protein level, myoglobin level and TCM therapy duration were likely associated with treatment outcomes of H7N9 infection (P \u003d 0.032, 0.041 and 0.017, respectively).",
