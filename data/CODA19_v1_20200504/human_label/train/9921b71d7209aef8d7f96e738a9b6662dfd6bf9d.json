      "original_text": "There is a need for simple and inexpensive diagnostic and screening tests for the detection of Cryptosporidium parvum infection in calves. A sucrose wet mount test and a lateral immunochromatography test were evaluated for epidemiological sensitivity and specificity, cost per test, simplicity, test time and ease of batching. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) of the Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein (COWP) gene locus, with gel electrophoresis, was used as a gold standard. Cohen\u0027s kappa statistic of agreement (k) between the Ontario Veterinary College (OVC) sucrose wet mount test and COWP PCR-RFLP was 0.82, and the sensitivity and specificity of the OVC sucrose wet mount test were 88.6% and 93.8%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the lateral immunochromatography test were 78.3% and 93.3%, respectively, and agreement between this test and PCR-RFLP was good (k \u003d 0.73). There was substantial agreement between the OVC sucrose wet mount test and the lateral immunochromatography test (k \u003d 0.84). Both tests were inexpensive and easy to use; however, the lateral immunochromatography test was faster and simpler to perform than the sucrose wet mount test, and was generally more user-friendly. These tests provide practitioners and researchers with cheap, quick and accurate methods of detecting C. parvum infection in young calves. #",
