      "original_text": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect atherosclerotic lesions containing accumulations of ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxides (USPIO). Positing that improved USPIO with a higher affinity for atherosclerotic plaques would yield better plaque images, we performed MRI and histologic studies to compare the uptake of dextran-and mannan-dextrancoated USPIO (D-USPIO and DM-USPIO, respectively) by the atherosclerotic walls of rabbits. We intravenously injected atherosclerotic rabbits with DM-USPIO (n \u003d 5) or D-USPIO (n \u003d 5). Two rabbits were the controls. The doses delivered were 0.08 (dose 1) (n \u003d 1), 0.4 (dose 2) (n \u003d 1), or 0.8 (dose 3) (n \u003d 3) mmol iron/Kg. The dose 3 rabbits underwent in vivo contrastenhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) before and 5 days after USPIO administration. Afterwards, all animals were euthanized, the aortae were removed and subjected to in vitro MRI study. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the aortic wall in the same region of interest (ROI) was calculated in both in vivo and in vitro studies. Histological assessment through measurement of iron-positive regions in Prussian blue-stained specimens showed that iron-positive regions were significantly larger in rabbits injected with DM-rather than D-USPIO (P , 0.05) for all doses.",
