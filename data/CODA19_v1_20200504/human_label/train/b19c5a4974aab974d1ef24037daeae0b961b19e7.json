However, little is known about the underlying mechanism through which communicative behaviors influence preventive behaviors. Thus, in the context of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in South Korea, this study investigated how two communicative behaviors (message expression and reception) in SNSs affected the communicators\u0027 intentions to engage in MERS-preventive behaviors. Using data collected from a nationally representative panel survey of 1000 Korean adults aged 19 or older, we examined a theoretical expression and reception effects model. Results support the presence of effects from expressing and receiving MERS-related information via SNSs and their underlying mechanism during South Korea\u0027s MERS outbreak. Public health officials and communication professionals should actively use SNS communication in coping with public health crisis caused by emerging infectious diseases.",
