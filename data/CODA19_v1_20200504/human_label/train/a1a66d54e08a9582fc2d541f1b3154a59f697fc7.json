The detection rate of suckling pigs, weaning pigs, growers and finishers were 14.3% (12/84), 6.5% (7/107), 7% (3/43), and 0% (0/5), respectively. Symptoms were neurological, respiratory, enteric sign (diarrhea), or nasal bleeding. All pigs were co-infected with other viruses and bacteria and this might have resulted in age variation and clinical signs in the affected pigs. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the PHEV-positive samples and PHEV reference strains were clustered in the same group. These findings imply the presence of only one genogroup of PHEV, regardless of porcine age, clinical signs, and geographical location.",
