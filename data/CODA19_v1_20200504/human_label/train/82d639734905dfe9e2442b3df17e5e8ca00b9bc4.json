      "original_text": "Traditional vaccines such as inactivated or live attenuated vaccines, are gradually giving way to more biochemically de fi ned vaccines that are most often based on a recombinant antigen known to possess neutralizing epitopes. Such vaccines can offer improvements in speed, safety and manufacturing process but an inevitable consequence of their high degree of puri fi cation is that immunogenicity is reduced through the lack of the innate triggering molecules present in more complex preparations. Targeting recombinant vaccines to antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells however can improve immunogenicity by ensuring that antigen processing is as ef fi cient as possible. Immune complexes, one of a number of routes of APC targeting, are mimicked by a recombinant approach, crystallizable fragment (Fc) fusion proteins, in which the target immunogen is linked directly to an antibody effector domain capable of interaction with receptors, FcR, on the APC cell surface. A number of virus Fc fusion proteins have been expressed in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system and shown to be ef fi ciently produced and puri fi ed. Their use for immunization next to non-Fc tagged equivalents shows that they are powerfully immunogenic in the absence of added adjuvant and that immune stimulation is the result of the Fc-FcR interaction.",
