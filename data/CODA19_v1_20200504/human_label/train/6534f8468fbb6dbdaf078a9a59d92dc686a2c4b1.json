In this report, the development of a cell-based, medium to high throughput screening assay that is capable of monitoring EPAC-mediated activation of cellular Rap1 in an isoform-specific manner is described. This assay adapts a conventional ELISA format with immobilized RalGDS-RBD as a bait to selectively capture GTP-bound active Rap1. As a result, it fills an urgent need for a cell-based EPAC assay that can be conveniently performed using microtiter plates for the discovery and/or validation of isoform-specific EPAC agonists and antagonists.",

Extensive studies have demonstrated that EPAC proteins are important signaling molecules involved in modulating a myriad of physiological functions 3-5 , ranging from energy homeostasis 6-8 and insulin secretion 9, 10 to learning and memory 11, 12 . In addition, EPAC proteins have also been shown to act as major stress-response mediators and play key roles in the development of human diseases, such as cancer 13-16 , chronic pain 17-19 , cardiovascular diseases 20, 21 and infection 22, 23 . Therefore, developing small molecule EPAC-specific modulators has evolved into an active area of research within the field for the last few years [24] [25] [26] . Several recent studies have reported the effective development of EPAC-specific antagonists using high throughput screening (HTS) biochemical assays 27-29 . However, a robust cell-based assay equipped to measure the activity of EPAC proteins in a medium to high throughput setup is lacking. In this study, the design and execution of an isoform specific cell-based assay capable of measuring cellular activity of EPAC proteins in a microplate format are described.",

Activation of EPAC1 or EPAC2 in these cell lines by cAMP elevating agents leads to the accumulation of Flag-Rap1-GTP, which can be captured by RalGDS-RBD immobilized in a nickel-coated 96-well microplate.
