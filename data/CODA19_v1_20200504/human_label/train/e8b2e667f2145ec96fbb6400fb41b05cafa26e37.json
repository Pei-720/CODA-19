Additionally, the IC 50 of the P. alata (ELPA) leaf extracts was 25 determined against both tumor (HCT-116, SF-295, OVACAR-8, and HL-60), and non-tumor 26 cells (PBMC). The ELPA flavonoids were identified by HPLC-DAD and UHPLC-MS/MS. 27 The morphological analyses used light and fluorescence microscopy, and cell cycle and DNA 28 fragmentation analyses used flow cytometry to determine the mechanism of cell death induced 29 by ELPA in HL-60. Among the Passiflora leaf extracts evaluated; ELPA stood out with high 30 cytotoxic activity, followed by P. capsularis and P. quadrangulares with varying high and low 31 cytotoxic activity. ELPA presented high cytotoxic potency in HL-60 (IC 50 19.37 μg/mL), yet 32 without cytotoxic activity against PBMC, suggesting selectivity for tumor cells. The cytotoxic 33 activity of ELPA may well be linked to the presence of ten identified flavonoids. Cells treated 34 with ELPA presented the hallmarks typical of apoptosis and necrosis, with cell cycle arrest in 35 the G2/M phase. Conclusion: From among the studied species, ELPA presented greater 36 cytotoxic activity, possibly a consequence of synergistic flavonoid action which induces cell 37 death by apoptosis and necrosis.",
