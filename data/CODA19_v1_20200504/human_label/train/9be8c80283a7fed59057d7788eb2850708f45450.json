Silver nanoparticles were synthesized, via sodium citrate and silver nitrate addition into a boiling aqueous solution of curcumin, monomers and surfactant. curcumin and sodium citrate promoted silver nucleation, acting as reducing and stabilizing agents. these curcumin-capped Agnps enabled, after adding the radical polymerization initiator, the assembling of the growing polymer chains around the hydrophobic Agnp surface. the resultant core-doped shell nanohybrids exhibit plasmonic, luminescent and volume thermoresponsive properties, with improved possibilities to be used as successful therapeutic platforms. In fact, the possibility to nanoconfine the synergistic antioxidant, antiviral, antibacterial features of silver and curcumin in one bioavailable hybrid paves the way to promising applications in the biomedical field.",

Previous backgrounds evidenced the curcumin ability to reduce Ag + and Au 3+ ions to silver 20-22 and gold 23 nanoparticles, without any other additional reductant or in the presence of citrate and CTBA to modulate NP shape 24 . Thus, Kundu and Nithiyanantham 20 , in a pioneer work, were able to synthesize different shapes of AgNP (spheres, nanowires and anisotropic nanoflakes) by tuning the molar ratio of curcumin to AgNO 3 . Nevertheless, even though the reductant ability of curcumin has been already reported, it should be noted that, as far as we know, none has postulated that hydrophobic curcumin presence nearby metal surface may facilitate polymer self-assembling during post-crosslinking polymerization. In addition, by considering the antioxidant properties of this natural phenolic compound, our curcumin-promoted Ag@nanogel hybrid system will state a double benefit arising from the biomedical properties of curcumin itself, as antibacterial, self-healing 25,26 , antiviral 27 and anti-inflammatory 28 ; and from the antibacterial 19 synergistic effect and remarkable antiviral 29 activity of particles comprising silver nanoparticles and curcumin in one hybrid. Moreover, encapsulation of curcumin in the hydrophobic polymer shell will increase curcumin bioavailability protecting curcumin from hydrolytic degradation 30 , since this is the main limitation for its therapeutic applications. experimental Materials.
