      "original_text": "The new porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) has caused devastating economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. Despite extensive research on the relationship between autophagy and virus infection, the concrete role of autophagy in porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection has not been reported. In this study, autophagy was demonstrated to be triggered by the effective replication of PEDV through transmission electron microscopy, confocal microscopy, and Western blot analysis. Moreover, autophagy was confirmed to benefit PEDV replication by using autophagy regulators and RNA interference. Furthermore, autophagy might be associated with the expression of inflammatory cytokines and have a positive feedback loop with the NF-κB signaling pathway during PEDV infection. This work is the first attempt to explore the complex interplay between autophagy and PEDV infection. Our findings might accelerate our understanding of the pathogenesis of PEDV infection and provide new insights into the development of effective therapeutic strategies.",

Autophagy can be induced by diverse intracellular and extracellular stimuli, such as nutrient starvation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and virus infection [10] . Increasing evidence indicates that autophagy plays both anti-viral and pro-viral roles in the life cycles and pathogenesis of a broad range of viruses [11] . Specifically, autophagy is an intrinsic host defense mechanism that inhibits viral replication or eliminates viruses by delivering them to the lysosomal compartment for degradation. Meanwhile, viruses develop many mechanisms to block autophagy or even hijack it for their own benefit, such as human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) [9, [12] [13] [14] . However, autophagy is also believed to serve as a platform for viral replication, especially for RNA viruses, such as classical swine fever virus (CSFV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and rotavirus (RV), utilizing the membranes of the autophagosome-like vesicles for their replication [15] [16] [17] .
