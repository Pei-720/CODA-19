Some of these proteins, such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymers, helicase and main protease, are well conserved between SARS-CoV-2 and the original SARS virus, but several others are not. This study examines one of the most novel proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2, a macrodomain of nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3). Although 26% of the amino acids in this SARS-CoV-2 macrodomain differ from those seen in other coronaviruses, the protein retains the ability to bind ADPribose, which is an important characteristic of beta coronaviruses, and potential therapeutic target. author/funder.
