      "original_text": "Introduction: Prognosis of enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma is poor but predictors of survival remain ill-defined. How clinical presentation, pathological features and therapies influence outcome was evaluated in 37 thoroughly characterized patients with celiac disease and T-cell lymphoma. Patients and methods: Medical files were studied retrospectively. Lymphoma and intestinal mucosa were analysed by histopathology, multiplex PCR and intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes phenotyping. Survival and prognostic factors were analysed using Kaplan-Meier curves with Logrank test and Cox Model. Results: Lymphoma complicated non clonal enteropathy, celiac disease (n \u003d 15) and type I refractory celiac disease (n \u003d 2) in 17 patients and clonal type II refractory celiac disease in 20 patients. Twenty-five patients underwent surgery with resection of the main tumour mass in 22 cases. In univariate analysis, non clonal celiac disease, serum albumin level \u003e 21.6 g/L at diagnosis, chemotherapy and surgical resection predicted good survival (p \u003d 0.0007, p \u003c 0.0001, p \u003c 0.0001, p \u003c 0.0001, respectively). In multivariate analysis, serum albumin level \u003e 21.6 g/L, chemotherapy and reductive surgery were all significantly associated with increased survival (p \u003c 0.002, p \u003c 0.03, p \u003c 0.03, respectively). Conclusions: Our study underlines the prognostic value of celiac disease type in patients with T-cell lymphoma, and suggests that a combination of nutritional, chemotherapy and reductive surgery may improve survival.",
