Epidemiological exposure data, patient characteristics, clinical symptoms, laboratory and imaging findings and medical history were extracted from electronic medical records and analysed by licensed physicians. Laboratory data were recorded in standardized form. Initial investigations included a complete blood count, routine urinalysis, blood gases, coagulation function, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum biochemical testing (including renal and liver function, serum lactate, lactate dehydrogenase, and electrolytes). To characterize the effect of coronavirus on the immune system, immunologic factors including serum immunoglobulin, complements, cytokines, rheumatoid factor (RF) and T cell and leukocyte subpopulations were analysed by flow cytometry.",
