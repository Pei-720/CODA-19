HA was observed at all temperatures with chicken, mouse, rat, and hamste~ erythrocytes but not with erythrocytes of human (O), cattle, horses, ~heep, guinea pigs, geese, duck~, pigeons and l-day-old chicks. Chickens showed a~ individual variation in agglutinability of their erythrocytes, requiring selection of birds to obtain erythrocytes for HA. HA reaction was inhibited by specific antiserum. Some factors involved in HA and HA inhibition (HI) were investigated and standard HA and HI tests were worked out.",
