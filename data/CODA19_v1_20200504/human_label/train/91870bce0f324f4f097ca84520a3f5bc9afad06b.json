      "original_text": "Up to November 2014, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has infected 935 individuals and killed 371, all originating in or with links to the Middle East. The mechanisms of transmission of the disease are not fully understood, but MERS-CoV seems to sustain itself in the human population through repeated re-introduction from a camel reservoir and is able to cause nosocomial outbreaks. The risk of a global spread of MERS-CoV is low. Epidemiological, serological and phylogenetic research, combined with one health surveillance, dynamic case definitions, active case finding, rigorous infection control, culturally sensitive risk communication and a continuous re-evaluation of new evidence will enable to better understand the disease, limit its spread and quantify its risk in order to better prepare for a hypothetical spread.",
