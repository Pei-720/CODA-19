Two of the variants are similar to those identified in Japan: one contains a 194-aa deletion, the same as PEDV variant TTR-2/ JPN/2014, while the other contains a 204-aa deletion, the same as PEDV variant JKa-292/CS1de204. Two new S1 NTDdel PEDV variants were found: one contains a 201-aa deletion located at residues 30-230 and the other contains a 202-aa deletion located at residues 24-225 of the S protein. This is the first report on coinfection of S1 NTD-del PEDV variants and the original US PEDV strain in US pigs, indicating that PEDV continues to evolve in pigs and might be responsible for disease pattern changes.",
