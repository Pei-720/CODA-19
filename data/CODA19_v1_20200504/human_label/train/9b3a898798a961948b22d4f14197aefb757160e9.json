Intracerebral infection of C57BL/1 OSNJ mice with Theiler\u0027s virus results in acute encephalitis with subsequent virus clearance and absence of spinal cord demyelination . In contrast, infection of SJL/J mice results in acute encephalitis, virus persistence, and immune-mediated demyelination . These experiments examined the role of T-cell subsets in the in vivo immune response to Theiler\u0027s virus in resistant C57BL/10SNJ mice . Depletion of T-cell subsets with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed at CD3 (pan-T-cell marker), CD4\u0027 (class 11-restricted) or CD8\u0027 (class I-restricted) T cells resulted in increased frequency of paralysis and death as a result of acute encephalitis . Neuropathologic studies 10 days after infection demonstrated prominent necrosis, primarily in the pyramidal layer of hippocampus and in the thalamus of mice depleted of T-cell subsets . In immunosuppressed and infected C57BL/10SNJ mice, analysis of spinal cord sections 35 days after infection demonstrated small demyelinated lesions relatively devoid of inflammatory cells even though virus antigen could be detected by immunocytochemistry . Both CD4\u0027 and CD8\u0027 T cells are important in the resistance to infection with Theiler\u0027s virus in C57BL/1 OSNJ mice . However, subsequent spinal cord demyelination, to the extent observed in susceptible mice, depends on the presence of virus antigen persistence and a competent cellular immune response .",
