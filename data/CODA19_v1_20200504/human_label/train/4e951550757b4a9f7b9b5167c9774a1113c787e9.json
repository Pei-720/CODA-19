During the observer-blind study, local and systemic reactions were generally similar for both vaccines 1-22 days post-vaccination; however, injection-site induration was more frequent among the Subunit group (P \u003c 0.05), and mild pain at the injection site and fever were more frequent among Sub/MF59™ recipients (P ≤ 0.005). Both vaccines induced a significant (P \u003c 0.001) increase in geometric mean titres (GMTs) for the three strains tested, versus baseline; GMTs against A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B were significantly higher in the Sub/ MF59™ group (P \u003d 0.034, P \u003c 0.001 and P \u003d 0.005, respectively). GMT ratios against A/H1N1, A/ H3N2 and B were also significantly higher in the Sub/MF59™ group (P \u003d 0.038, P \u003c 0.001 and P \u003d 0.006, respectively). Similarly, the percentage of subjects achieving seroprotection or seroconversion on Day 22 was greater for Sub/MF59™ recipients, reaching significance for A/ H3N2 (P \u003c 0.001).",
