This focused set of public health competencies has begun to guide relevant components of the University of Toronto\u0027s Family Medicine Residency Program curriculum, including academic half-days; clinical experiences, especially identifying \"teachable moments\" during patient encounters; resident academic projects; and elective public health agency placements. These competencies will also be used to guide the development of a family medicine-public health primer and faculty development sessions to support family medicine faculty facilitating residents to achieve these competencies. Once more fully implemented, an evaluation will be initiated to determine the degree to which these public health competencies are being achieved by family medicine graduates, especially whether they attained the knowledge, skills, and confıdence necessary to effectively face diverse public health situations-from common to emergent.
