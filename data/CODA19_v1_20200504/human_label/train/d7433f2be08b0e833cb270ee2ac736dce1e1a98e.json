Results were generated using MPNet [1] [2] [3] . Table S4 .1 shows the results for just the bipartite network. Column 1 lists the various statistics that are evaluated. Column 2 shows the value of the statistic for the empirical network (\"Sample\"). Columns 3 and 4 show the mean (\"Mean\") and sample standard deviation (\"Std. Dev.\"), respectively, of the statistic over simulated networks. Column 5 shows the \"t-ratio\", defined as (observed value-mean value)/standard deviation. For each parameter, using standard methodology, the model is a good fit for the empirical network if the \"t-ratio\" has absolute value less than 0.1 for parameters explicitly in the model (shown in boldface) and less than 2 otherwise.",
