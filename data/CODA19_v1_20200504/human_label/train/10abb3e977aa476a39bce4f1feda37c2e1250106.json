      "original_text": "26 Previous findings of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)-27 related viruses in bats, and the ability of Tylonycteris-BatCoV HKU4 spike protein to utilize 28 MERS-CoV receptor, human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 hDPP4, suggest a bat ancestral origin of 29 MERS-CoV. We developed 12 primary bat cell lines from seven bat species, including 30 Tylonycteris pachypus, Pipistrellus abramus and Rhinolophus sinicus (hosts of Tylonycteris-31 BatCoV HKU4, Pipistrellus-BatCoV HKU5 and SARS-related-CoV respectively), and tested 32 their susceptibilities to MERS-CoVs, SARS-CoV and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E). 33 Five cell lines, including P. abramus and R. sinicus but not T. pachypus cells, were susceptible 34 to human MERS-CoV EMC/2012. However, three tested camel MERS-CoV strains showed 35 different infectivities, with only two strains capable of infecting three and one cell lines 36 respectively. SARS-CoV can only replicate in R. sinicus cells, while HCoV-229E cannot 37 replicate in any bat cells. Bat dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) sequences were closely related to 38 those of human and non-human primates but distinct from dromedary DPP4 sequence. Critical 39 residues for binding to MERS-CoV spike protein were mostly conserved in bat DPP4. DPP4 40 was expressed in the five bat cells susceptible to MERS-CoV, with significantly higher mRNA 41 expression levels than those in non-susceptible cells (P\u003d0.0174), supporting that DPP4 42 expression is critical for MERS-CoV infection in bats. However, overexpression of T. pachypus 43 DPP4 failed to confer MERS-CoV susceptibility in T. pachypus cells, suggesting other cellular 44 factors in determining viral replication. The broad cellular tropism of MERS-CoV should 45 prompt further exploration of host diversity of related viruses to identify its ancestral origin. 46 47 All rights reserved.
