S is a quantity defined as S \u003d a 2 + c 2 + g 2 + t 2 , where a, c, g and t denote corresponding base frequencies. The Z-curve is a three dimensional curve that represents a DNA sequence in the manner that each can be uniquely reconstructed given the other. Elhaik et al. made 4 major claims. 1) In the previous mapping system with the regular tetrahedron, calculation of the radius of the inscribed sphere is \"a mathematical error\". 2) S follows an exponential distribution and is narrowly distributed with a range of (0.25 -0.33). 3) Based on the Chargaff\u0027s second parity rule (PR2), \"S is equivalent to H [Shannon entropy]\" and they are derivable from each other. 4) Z-curve \"suffers from over dimensionality\", because based on the analysis of 235 bacterial genomes, x and y components contributed only less than 1% of the variance and therefore \"would be of little use\".",
