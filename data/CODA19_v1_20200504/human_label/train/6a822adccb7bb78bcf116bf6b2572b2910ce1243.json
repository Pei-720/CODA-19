      "original_text": "Thymopentin (Tp5) was loaded in poly-butylcyanoacrylate (PBCA) nanoparticles (NP) in order to enhance the oral bioavailability of Tp5. PBCA-Tp5-NP was prepared by nanoprecipitation methods. Dialyzing membrane method was employed to examine the in vitro release of PBCA-Tp5-NP in PBS, and Tp5 samples in the release medium were detected by HPLC. The cell proliferation test ( 3 H-thymidine) was conducted to verify the PBCA-Tp5-NP bioactivity in vitro. The pharmacodynamical studies were performed on preimmunoinhibited rats and in flow cytometer. The size and the entrapment efficiency of PBCA-Tp5-NP were 178 AE 39 nm and 92.21 AE 1.08%, respectively. In vitro release data show that less than 60% Tp5 was released from lyophilized PBCA-Tp5-NP while 80% Tp5 was released from the colloidal PBCA-Tp5-NPs in 48 h. The proliferation test showed that PBCA-Tp5-NP had the similar effect as Tp5. The in vivo data showed that oral PBCA-Tp5-NPs had similar function as what intravenous Tp5 did. The oral bioavailability of Tp5 could be enhanced by PBCA nanoparticles. PBCA-Tp5-NP had the property of sustained-release and the efficacy of Tp5 was not changed after formulation. ß",
