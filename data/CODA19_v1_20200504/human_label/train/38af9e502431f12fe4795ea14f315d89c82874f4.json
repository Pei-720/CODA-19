      "original_text": "The genomic region that codes for New SARS-Like Coronavirus 3C-like Protease was chemical synthesized following the sequence of Human betacoronavirus 2c EMC/2012 (HCoV-EMC). BamHI and XhoI restriction sites were attached to the 5\u0027 and 3\u0027 ends separately by PCR, and the PCR product was inserted into the pET-28b-SUMO vector. The recombinant plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) (TransGen Biotech). kanamycin-resistant colonies were grown in Luria-Bertani medium at 37 °C until the OD 600 reached 0.8. Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mM, and the cultures were grown for an additional 20 h at 16 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended, and homogenized in lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl 2",
