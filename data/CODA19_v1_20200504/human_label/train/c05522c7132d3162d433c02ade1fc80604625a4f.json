Here , we show that anti-JHM antibodies , in the absence of T or B cells , caused demyelination in JHM-infected mice. Anti-JHM antibody was detected adjacent to areas of demyelination, consistent with a direct interaction between antibody and infected cells. Demyelination was reduced by 85 to 90% in infected RAG1 ؊/؊ mice lacking normal expression of activating Fc receptors (FcR␥ ؊/؊ ) and by ϳ76% when complement was depleted by treatment with cobra venom factor. These data demonstrate that JHM-specific antibodies are sufficient to cause demyelination and that myelin destruction in the presence of anti-virus antibodies results from a combination of complement-and Fc receptor-dependent mechanisms.
