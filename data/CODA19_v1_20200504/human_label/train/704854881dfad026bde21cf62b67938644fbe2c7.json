The objective of this study was to estimate the median amount of money ED personnel would be willing to pay for preventing nosocomial severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Methods: A contingent valuation approach with close-ended format was used. During the study period from June 15, 2003 through June 30, 2003, a convenience sample of all medical personnel working in the ED of National Taiwan University Hospital was carried out. Participants were interviewed by a standard questionnaire and were asked to choose whether or not they would pay at a specified price to purchase a hypothetical SARS vaccine. A logistic regression model was created to evaluate the relationship between willingness-to-pay and the log of the price offered in the bid questions. The median and mean amounts of willingnessto-pay were calculated. Results: A total of 115 subjects were interviewed and most were nurses (68.7%).",
