      "original_text": "At the height of the SARS 1 crisis in spring 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) and China fought a silent battle over the prevalence of two competing norms in global health governance. On the one hand, the established norm of sovereignty, particularly the principle of non-interference, had structured a regime for dealing with infectious disease outbreaks that provided ground rules of conduct but ascribed decision-making authority to member states alone. It explicitly ruled out foreign or supranational interference. On the other hand, the emerging norm of global health security was built on an understanding of infectious disease outbreaks as international security problems requiring supranational coordination and governance capacity. In effect, it implied the subordination of national economic and political interests to global disease detection and containment efforts. Its proponents thus sought a prominent role for the WHO in taking decisions in response to global health emergencies which would entail interference with state sovereignty. By the time of the SARS outbreak, this normative tension was far from being resolved. On the contrary, the two central actors in this episode, the Chinese government and the WHO secretariat, turned it into a manifest norm conflict by demonstrating incompatible positional differences over the relative priority of the two norms. 2 Intriguingly, however, neither China nor the WHO resorted to discursive modes of contestation by justifying their respective positions with reference to normative arguments. Almost exclusively, they displayed incompatible normative expectations in the way they put the norms into practice. The WHO acted as if the norm of global health security had already been widely accepted, supplanting those aspects of the sovereignty norm with which it conflicted. Without prior legal or political authorization to do so, the organization took a set of unprecedented measures. Most importantly, it issued travel warnings for affected regions, devised emergency recommendations, and put pressure on governments (the Chinese in particular) to comply-clearly challenging the non-interference 1 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. 2 On the manifestation of norm conflicts, see Michael Zürn, Benjamin Faude and Christian Kreuder-Sonnen,",
