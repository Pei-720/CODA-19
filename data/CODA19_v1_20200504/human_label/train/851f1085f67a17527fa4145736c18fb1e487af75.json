      "original_text": "This study numerically investigated the thermal effect of human body on the time-dependent dispersion of cough droplets with evaporation process. The thermal flow of human body was imitated using a 3D thermal manikin with real body features, while a recent developed multi-component Eulerian-Lagrangian approach was used to address the effects of inhomogeneous temperature and humidity fields on droplet evaporation. By comparing the results yielded without and with the human body heat, the outcomes demonstrated strong impact of human body heat on the droplets mass fraction and local air velocity distributions. Inspirable droplets could potentially drop into respirable droplets by evaporation, although the evaporation rate was not significantly affected by body heat. The thermal effect of human body revealed its vital impacts on the time-dependent droplets dispersion. Due to the buoyancy driven thermal flow, both the vertical velocity and displacement of small droplets (≤20 μm) were completely reversed from descending to ascending, while the deposition time of large droplets (≥50 μm) were significantly delayed. With the reduced droplet size by evaporation and droplets lifted into breathing zone by human thermal effect, the inhalability and infection risks of cough droplets would be much higher in real occupied indoor spaces.",
