      "original_text": "Rhubarb (Rheum emodi, family Polygonaceae) has been traditionally used as diuretic, liver stimulant, purgative/cathartic, stomachic, anticholesterolaemic, antitumour, antiseptic and tonic. A number of anthraquinone derivatives including emodin, aloe-emodin, physcion, chrysophanol, rhein, emodin glycoside and chrysophanol glycoside occur as the main chemical constituents. In the past few years, new components such as sulfemodin 8-O-b-D-glucoside, revandchinone-1, revandchinone-2, revandchinone-3, revandchinone-4, 6-methyl-rhein and 6-methyl aloe-emodin have been reported from the same species. Anthraquinone derivatives show evidence of antifungal, anti-microbial, anti-Parkinson\u0027s, anti-proliferative, immuno-enhancing, antiviral and antioxidant activities. This review covers published work on botany, chemistry and therapeutic uses of different components from rhubarb.",
