KT029139.1 for wild type and KT868873.1 for I529T mutant) were cultured in a 24-well plate containing a monolayer of Vero E6 cells or 293T cells stably expressing CD26 (1). After 1 h incubation at 37°C, viral supernatant was removed and cells were overlaid with 1 mL of 1% methylcellulose in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium, including 10% fetal bovine serum. Plates were incubated for 3 d at 37°C, and then cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 100% methanol. The MERS-CoV plaques were detected using rabbit anti-MERS-CoV N protein antibody (Sino Biologic Inc.) and goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Invitrogen; https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/brands/invitrogen.html). Viral plaques were visualized by incubation with 0.05% 33-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and 0.01% hydrogen peroxide in 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Cellular layers were counterstained with trypan blue dye.",
