The results were correlated with structural properties like side chain volume, hydrophobicity, and secondary structure propensities of substituting residues. All 3CL pro prefer Gln at P1 position, Leu at P2 position, basic residues at P3 position, small hydrophobic residues at P4 position, and small residues at P1\u0027 and P2\u0027 positions. Despite 3CL pro from different groups of CoVs share many similarities in substrate specificities, differences in substrate specificities were observed at P4 positions, with IBV 3CL pro prefers P4-Pro and SARS-CoV 3CL pro prefers P4-Val. By combining the most favorable residues at P3 to P5 positions, we identified super-active substrate sequences \u0027VARLQQSGF\u0027 that can be cleaved efficiently by all 3CL pro with relative activity of 1.7 to 3.2, and \u0027VPRLQQSGF\u0027 that can be cleaved specifically by IBV 3CL pro with relative activity of 4.3.",
