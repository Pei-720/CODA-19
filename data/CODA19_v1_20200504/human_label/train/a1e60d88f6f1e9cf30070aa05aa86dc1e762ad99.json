The primary results of the RCT in non-smoking women have been previously published, along with a secondary analysis 1,2 . 69 of the participants in this study were randomised to the FENO based management intervention of MAP, and 73 subjects to the clinical guidelines-based management intervention of the MAP RCT. 15 subjects commenced MAP but were not randomised. The remaining 11 subjects who did not participate in the RCT were not eligible because they were recruited prior to commencement of the MAP study (n\u003d8), or did not wish to have their medications changed (n\u003d2), or were excluded from the MAP study on the basis of exacerbation history (more than 3 courses of OCS in the past year, n\u003d1)..",
