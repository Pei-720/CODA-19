      "original_text": "Porcine deltacoronavirus (δ-CoV) is the object of extensive research in several countries including the United States. In contrast, the epidemiology of δ-CoVs in wild birds in the US is largely unknown. Our aim was to comparatively assess the prevalence of δand γ-CoVs in wild migratory terrestrial and aquatic birds in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee and Wisconsin. A total of 1236 cloacal/fecal swabs collected during the period 2015-2018 were tested for γand δ-CoVs using genus-specific reverse transcription-PCR assays. A total of 61 (4.99%) samples were γ-CoV positive, with up to 29 positive samples per state. In contrast, only 14 samples were positive for δ-CoV (1.14%) with only 1-4 originating from the same state. Thus, unlike previous reports from Asia, γ-CoVs are more prevalent than δ-CoVs in the US, suggesting that δ-CoVs may spread in birds with lower efficiency. This may indicate δ-CoV emerging status and incomplete adaptation to new host species limiting its spread. Phylogenetic analysis of the partial N gene revealed that the newly identified δ-CoV strains were most closely related to the HKU20 (wigeon) strain. Further studies are necessary to investigate the role of aquatic bird δ-CoVs in the epidemiology of δ-CoVs in swine and terrestrial birds. Viruses 2019, 11, 897 2 of 11",

Porcine δ-CoV is being studied extensively in the US and elsewhere [4, 5] . In contrast, the diversity and epidemiology of δ-CoVs in wild birds in the US are largely unknown. The association of porcine δ-CoV with enteric disease in pigs and its continuous spread underscore an urgent need to further investigate the mechanisms of its persistence and spread. Extensive epidemiological studies are needed to evaluate δ-CoV prevalence in avian species, swine farms, pig-bird comingling sites and high pig-traffic sites such as abattoirs, assembly yards and truck washes. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of δand γ-CoVs in wild migratory terrestrial and aquatic birds in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee, and Wisconsin.
