      "original_text": "Infiltration of activated lymphocytes into the central nervous system (CNS) is potentially harmful by damaging resident cells through release of cytokines. Among these is IFN-γ that is secreted by activated natural killer (NK) cells and T lymphocytes and can exert a cytotoxic effect on resident glial populations including oligodendrocytes. Here we show that treatment of mouse oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC)-enriched cultures with IFN-γ resulted in a dose-dependent increase in apoptosis. IFN-γ-induced apoptosis is mediated, in part, through induction of the CXC chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10; IP-10) from cultured OPCs. Treatment of OPCs with CXCL10 resulted in cell death in a concentration-dependent manner and IFN-γ-treatment of CXCL10−/− OPCs resulted in \u003e50% reduction in cell death. Further, treatment of CXCR3−/− OPC cultures with either IFN-γ or CXCL10 resulted in reduced cell death supporting an important role for CXCL10 signaling in IFN-γ-mediated OPC apoptosis. Data is also provided demonstrating that signaling through CXCR2 protects either IFN-γ or CXCL10-treated OPC cultures from apoptosis and this effect is abolished in CXCR2−/− OPCs. CXCR2-mediated protection from apoptosis is associated with impaired cleavage of caspase 3 and elevated expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. These findings demonstrate a previously unappreciated role for CXCL10 in contributing to neuropathology by promoting oligodendrocyte apoptosis and emphasize the potential relevance in targeting CXCL10 in treating human demyelinating diseases including multiple sclerosis (MS).",
