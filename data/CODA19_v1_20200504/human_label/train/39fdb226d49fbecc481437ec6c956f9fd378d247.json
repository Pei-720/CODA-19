      "original_text": "Bovine coronavirus (BCV) and hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV) from swine were found to grow to high titers in MDCK I cells, a subline of Madin Darby canine kidney cells . Virus grown in these cells was used to isolate and purify the HE-protein . This protein has been shown recently to have acetylesterase activity and to function as the receptor-destroying enzyme of BCV . Here we show that HEV contains this enzyme, too . The glycoproteins were solubilized by treatment of virions with octylglucoside . Following centrifugation through a sucrose gradient the surface proteins S and HE (hemagglutinin-esterase) were obtained in purified form . After removal of the detergent by dialysis, HE formed rosettes as shown by electron microscopy . The purified HE protein retained acetylesterase activity and was able to function as a receptor-destroying enzyme rendering red blood cells resistant against agglutination by both coronaviruses . H E protein released from the viral membrane failed to agglutinate red blood cells . However, it was found to recognize glycoconjugates containing N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid as indicated by a binding assay with rat serum proteins blotted to nitrocellulose and by its ability to inhibit the hemagglutinating activity of BCV, HEV, and influenza C virus . The purified enzyme provides a useful tool for analyzing the cellular",
