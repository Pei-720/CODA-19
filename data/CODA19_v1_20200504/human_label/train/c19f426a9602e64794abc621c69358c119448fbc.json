      "original_text": "Five-membered aromatic systems with three heteroatoms at symmetrical positions, such as the 1,3,4-thiadiazole ring, have been extensively studied due to their pharmacological profile and physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties. 1,3,4-Thiadiazole derivatives are known as compounds having significant and diverse biological activities such as antibacterial, antifungal, antitubercular [20], analgesic and anti-inflammatory [21, 22] , antidepressant and anxiolytic [23], kinesin inhibitors [24], etc. The 1,3,4-thiadiazole ring is also found in several medicines such as acetazolamide, methazolamide, cefazolin, cefazedone, sulfamethizole or megazol [20, [25] [26] [27] . The 1,3,4-thiadiazole nucleus provides the compounds with high lipophilicity and the ability to form mesoionic systems associated with discrete regions of positive and negative charges. These distinct features allow mesoionic compounds to efficiently cross cellular membranes, leading to good oral absorption, bioavailability and strong unique interactions with biological molecules (e.g., DNA, proteins, etc.) thus increasing the potential of 1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives to exhibit biological activities [20, [27] [28] [29] . The thiadiazole ring is a bioisostere of the pyrimidine and pyridazine rings. The pyrimidine nucleus is commonly found in naturally occurring compounds of biochemical importance, as well as in drugs (e.g., pyrimidine nucleosides and nucleotides, nucleic acids, antiviral drugs), while the pyridazine nucleus is a component of some pharmacologically active compounds [20, [30] [31] [32] . The thiadiazole ring also acts as a bioisostere of the thiazole ring, and therefore thiadiazole derivatives can act in the same way as third-and fourth-generation antibacterial cephalosporins. This is an additional feature that highlights the high potential of this ring system in medicinal chemistry [20, 28] . Many researchers suppose there is a connection between the biological potential of 1,3,4-thiadiazoles and the strongly aromatic character of the 1,3,4-thiadiazole ring, as well as the presence of the toxophoric \u003dN-C-Slinkage group. Furthermore, the high in vivo stability and low toxicity for higher organisms are also attributed to the 1,3,4-thiadiazole ring [20, 33, 34] . In addition, the amine derivatives of 1,3,4-thiadiazole are also studied. 2-Amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole moiety and its derivatives are known for their antitumor, antitrypanosomal and uricogenic properties [20, 25, 27, [35] [36] [37] [38] . 2-Amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives are currently being synthesized in many laboratories, and in previous papers, we described several 2-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazoles that exhibit antibacterial, antifungal, antitubercular [20, [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] , and antiparasitic activities [27, 38] . The purpose of this paper is to present some small molecules possessing the 2-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole moiety that have shown antiviral activity.",
