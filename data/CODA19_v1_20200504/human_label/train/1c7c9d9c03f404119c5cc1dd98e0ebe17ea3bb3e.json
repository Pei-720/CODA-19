      "original_text": "During Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infection hepatitis is a potentially life threatening complication, particularly in newborns. Studies with type I interferon (IFN-I) receptor (IFNAR)-deficient mice revealed a key role of the IFN-I axis in the protection against CVB3 infection, whereas the source of IFN-I and cell types that have to be IFNAR triggered in order to promote survival are still unknown. We found that CVB3 infected IFN-β reporter mice showed effective reporter induction, especially in hepatocytes and only to a minor extent in liver-resident macrophages. Accordingly, upon in vitro CVB3 infection of primary hepatocytes from murine or human origin abundant IFN-β responses were induced. To identify sites of IFNAR-triggering we performed experiments with Mx reporter mice, which upon CVB3 infection showed massive luciferase induction in the liver. Immunohistological studies revealed that during CVB3 infection MX1 expression of hepatocytes was induced primarily by IFNAR-, and not by IFN-III receptor (IFNLR)-triggering.

Infections with CVB3 are mostly unnoticed or cause flu-like symptoms, however, they can also cause severe disease, such as myocarditis, pancreatitis, and hepatitis. Although CVB3 does not efficiently trigger plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which are the main IFN-I producers in many other virus infections, IFNAR signaling plays a crucial role in CVB3 control. Therefore, we investigated which cells are stimulated to produce IFN-I following CVB3 infection and which cell types have to be IFNAR-triggered in order to confer antiviral protection. We found that upon CVB3 infection IFN-β was mainly expressed within the liver, especially by hepatocytes and not by liver resident macrophages. This was corroborated by in vitro CVB3 infection experiments with primary murine and human hepatocytes. Interestingly, IFNAR signaling of hepatocytes was required to control the virus. Collectively, our data indicate that hepatocytes, and not immune cells, are the key innate effector cells that are relevant for the control of CVB3 infection.",
