      "original_text": "The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a lethal inflammatory disorder of the lung. Its incidence is estimated at 75 cases per 100,000 population and appears to be increasing [1] . Even with optimal treatment, mortality is about 30% [1-3]. As such, ARDS represents a major public health problem. The effects of two recent crises created by unusual viral infections of the respiratory tract -the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic caused by the novel SARS coronavirus [4, 5] and the bird flu [6] highlight the importance of research into ARDS. Both viruses cause an ARDS-like picture. Because lung repair and regeneration contribute substantially to the pathophysiology of ARDS, understanding these processes is essential [7] . This chapter focuses on specific cell populations and markers involved in cell division and regeneration. In addition, a brief review of two pathways intimately associated with cell division is provided because of their potential for pharmacologic manipulation.",
