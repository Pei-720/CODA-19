The resulted amplicons were separated by gel electrophoresis, and the DNA fragments were excised, purified and subjected to sequencing in both directions. The obtained sequences were verified by basic local alignment search tool. As for the amplification of complete N gene region, cDNA was synthesized by using SuperScript III First Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen, USA) with NR2 primer (Table 1). Two microliters of the generated cDNA was subjected to one round of PCR cycle by using MyFi ™ Mix Kit (Bioline, USA) with NF1 and NR2 (Table 1) primers following the parameters: 95 °C for 1 min followed by 25 cycles at 95 °C for 15 seconds, 52 °C for 15 seconds and 72 °C for 30 seconds and terminal elongation at 72 °C for 5 min. Then, 0.5 μL of the resulted PCR amplicon was further subjected to the second round PCR following the abovementioned parameters. The resulted PCR product was separated by gel electrophoresis while the DNA fragment was excised, purified and subjected to sequencing by using NF1, NR1, NF2, NR2 and N350R primers.",
