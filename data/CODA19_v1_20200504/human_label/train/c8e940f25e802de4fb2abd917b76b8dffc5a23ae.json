During fasting, activation of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARA) promotes the utilization of lipids as an energy source. Herein, we show that ligand activation of PPARA directly upregulates the long non-coding RNA gene Gm15441 through binding sites within its promoter. Gm15441 expression suppresses its antisense transcript, encoding thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP). This, in turn, decreases TXNIP-stimulated NLRP3 inflammasome activation, caspase-1 (CASP1) cleavage, and proinflammatory interleukin 1 beta (IL1B) maturation. Gm15441-null mice were developed and shown to be more susceptible to NLRP3 inflammasome activation and to exhibit elevated CASP1 and IL1B cleavage in response to metabolic and inflammatory stimuli. These findings provide evidence for a novel mechanism by which PPARA attenuates hepatic inflammasome activation in response to metabolic stress through lncRNA Gm15441 induction.",
