These proteins are crucial for the pathogenicity and replication of viruses as they aid in various stages of the viral life cycle, from genome uncoating to viral release. In addition, the ion channel activity of viroporin causes disruption in the cellular ion homeostasis, in particular the calcium ion. Fluctuation in the calcium level triggers the activation of the host defensive programmed cell death pathways as well as the inflammasome, which in turn are being subverted for the viruses\u0027 replication benefits. This review article summarizes recent developments in the functional investigation of viroporins from various viruses and their contributions to viral replication and virulence.",

Single TMD viroporins in subclass A have their N terminus facing the ER lumen while those in subclass B have their C-terminal tails in the ER lumen. For Class IIA and IIB viroporins, both N-and C-terminus are inside the ER lumen or the cytoplasmic matrix, respectively (Figure 1 ). An additional third class of viroporins may be necessary as viroporins with three-pass TMD have been proposed, such as the non-structural protein 4 (NSP4) of rotavirus [49] and 3a of severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS-CoV [31]. Due to their high structural variability under different conditions, solving the architecture of viroporins under physiological environment has been difficult. However, recent advancement in technology such as the ability to characterize protein structure at the atomic resolution using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)",
