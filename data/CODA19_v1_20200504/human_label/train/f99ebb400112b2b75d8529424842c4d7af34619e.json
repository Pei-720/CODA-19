Worldwide, approximately 2.5 billion people live in dengue-infested regions with about 100 million new cases each year, although many of these infections are believed to be silent. There are four antigenically distinct serotypes of dengue virus; thus, immunity from one serotype will not cross-protect from infection with the other three. The difficulties that hamper vaccine development include requirements of the natural conformation of the envelope glycoprotein to induce neutralizing immune responses and the necessity of presenting antigens of all four serotypes. Currently, the only way to meet these requirements is to use a mixture of four serotypes of live attenuated dengue viruses, but safety remains a major problem. In this study, we have developed the basis for a tetravalent dengue vaccine using a novel complex adenovirus platform that is capable of expressing multiple antigens de novo. This dengue vaccine is constructed as a pair of vectors that each expresses the premembrane and envelope genes of two different dengue virus serotypes.",

These genes are translated from the positive-stranded RNA genome as a single polyprotein that is cleaved into individual proteins by cellular and viral proteases. Despite the structural similarities, there is variation in the genetic sequences of each serotype mainly in the membrane glycoproteins (prM and E) that results in antigenic distinction and lack of cross protection among the serotypes. Furthermore, subsequent infection with an alternate serotype may enhance disease severity, contributing to the onset of DHF or DSS. One possibility for this disease enhancement is that (nonneutralizing) antibodies may be aiding in viral entry into host cells, thereby enhancing the infection. Alternatively, broadly reactive cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses to DEN antigens, in the absence of neutralizing responses, may accelerate the destruction of host cells.",
