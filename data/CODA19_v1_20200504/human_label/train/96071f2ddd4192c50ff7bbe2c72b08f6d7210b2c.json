      "original_text": "From an aqueous decoction of the traditional Chinese medicine \"ban lan gen\" (the Isatis indigotica root), an antiviral natural product CI -39 was isolated as an NNRTI (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor) (EC 50 ¼ 3.40 mM). Its novel structure was determined as methyl (1-methoxy-1H-indol-3-yl) acetamidobenzoate by spectroscopic data and confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Through synthesis and structure-activity relationship (SAR) investigation of CI -39 and 57 new derivatives (24 with EC 50 values of 0.06e8.55 mM), two optimized derivatives 10f and 10i (EC 50 : 0.06 mM and 0.06 mM) having activity comparable to that of NVP (EC 50 ¼ 0.03 mM) were obtained. Further evaluation verified that 10f and 10i were RT DNA polymerase inhibitors and exhibited better activities and drug resistance folds compared to NVP against seven NNRTI-resistant strains carrying different mutations. Especially, 10i",
