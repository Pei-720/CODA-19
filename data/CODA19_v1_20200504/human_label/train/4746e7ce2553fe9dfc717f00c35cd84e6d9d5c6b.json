      "original_text": "In three successive experiments, the immune functions of pigs persistently infected with the Ž . porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus PRRSV have been evaluated. Non-specific Ž . immune responses were analyzed over a period of 12 weeks post-infection PI . In addition, the capacity of PRRSV-infected pigs to develop an efficient immune response against pseudorabies Ž . virus PRV glycoproteins and to resist to a subsequent virulent challenge was investigated. Our results demonstrate that PRRSV produced minor effects on the immune system of pigs. The skin Ž . delayed type hypersensitivity DTH in response to phytohemagglutinine injection was slightly diminished one week after challenge, but was restored thereafter. However, three weeks after the infection, the total white blood cell count, and the number of CD2 q , CD8 q and IgM q cells were enhanced. The increase in numbers of CD8 q cells persisted for three consecutive weeks. Serum immunoglobulins in infected pigs also increased by week 3 PI and up to 8 weeks PI. These results show that PRRSV may have stimulating effects on the pig immune system during the phase of 0165-2427r98r$19.00 q 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",
