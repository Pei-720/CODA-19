However, cough is also the most frequent symptom of acute respiratory system diseases and is the most common reason why sick patients visit physicians. The largest diagnostic group associated with chronic cough is asthma or asthma-like syndromes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Furthermore, gastroesophageal reflux, rhinitis/postnasal drip syndrome and unpleasant side effects accompanying the therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) represent other causes of chronic cough. The cough reflex may be elicited by the activation of receptors of non-myelinated nociceptive Ad-fibers and C-fibers and receptors of myelinated Ad-fibers distributed throughout the respiratory tract. In recent times as proper cough receptors are thought to be rapidly adapting receptors (RARs) of myelinated fibers, C-fibers and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) localize on the non-myelinated fibers.",
