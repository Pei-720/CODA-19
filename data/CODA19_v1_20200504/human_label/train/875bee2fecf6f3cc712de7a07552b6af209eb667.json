      "original_text": "Primer extension by thermostable DNA polymerase in PCR starts from the 3 -end of a primer. If the PCR starting process fails, the entire PCR fails. Primer sequences at the 3 -end often interfere with success in PCR experiments. Over 2000 primer sequences from successful PCR experiments used with varieties of templates and conditions were analyzed for finding frequencies of the 3 -end triplets. This chapter discusses a trend in 3 -end triplet frequencies in primers used in successful PCR experiments and proposes requirements for the 3 -end of a primer. Finally, a method to select primers with the best 3 -end triplets is introduced based on the 3 -end analysis result.",
