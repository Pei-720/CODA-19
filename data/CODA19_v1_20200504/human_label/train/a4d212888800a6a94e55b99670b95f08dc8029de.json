      "original_text": "Nervilia fordii (Hance) Schltr. has been widely used as a medicinal and edible herb in Southwest China and Southeast Asia. In this study, NFP-1, a new water-soluble polysaccharidewith a purity of 97.8%, was purified from water extract of Nervilia fordii by DEAE-cellulose and Sephadex G-100 chromatography. NFP-1 has a relative molecular weight of 950 kDa determined by high performance gel-permeation chromatography (HPGPC). Its monosaccharide compositions were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) after pre-column derivatizing its hydrolysate with 1-phenyl-3-methyl-5-pyrazolone (PMP). NFP-1 mainly consists of galactose, arabinose, rhamnose, and galacturonic acid. Based on FT-IR, methylation and GC-MS analysis, and NMR, the structure unit of NFP-1 was established as →4)-α-Rhap-(2→ 4)-α-GalpA-(1→2)-α-Rhap-(1→2)-α-Rhap-(4→1)-β-Galp-T containing two branch chains of →2,4)-α-Rhap-(1→5)-α-Araf-(1→3)-α-Araf-(1→, and →2,4)-α-Rhap-(1→4)-β-Galp-(1→. The immunomodulatory assays revealed the dual-functionalities of NFP-1. NFP-1 could significantly induce the secretion of nitric oxide (NO), and promote the secretions of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β in RAW264.7 macrophages. NFP-1 could also significantly inhibit the production of NO, depress the secretions of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β in RAW264.7 macrophages activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and promote the production of IL-10 meanwhile. Our study suggested that Nervilia fordii could be an ideal medicinal or functional food due to its dual immunomodulatory activities.",
