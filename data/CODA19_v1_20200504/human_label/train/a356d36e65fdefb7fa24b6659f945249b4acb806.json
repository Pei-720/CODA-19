      "original_text": "This study explores how the public\u0027s belief in false rumors about Middle East Respiratory Syndrome that spread across South Korea related to their accuracy-oriented information seeking as well as the moderating effects of people\u0027s reasons for using social networking services (SNS). The survey results show that perceived credibility of false rumors did not affect accuracy-oriented information seeking. However, a significant result was shown in the moderating effect, such that SNS informational dependency interacted with false rumor credibility on accuracy-oriented information seeking. Overall, this study specifically identifies and discusses differences in SNS dependency and accuracy-oriented information seeking in the context of rumor communication to examine the construction of an informed public. Theoretical contributions of this study are discussed.",

Although previous studies revealed that media dependency and credibility are closely linked to each other (Jackob, 2010; Johnson and Kaye, 2004; Perlmutter and Schoen, 2007) , no studies have empirically tested the relationship in the context of rumors, particularly with a focus on Web 2.0 era to our knowledge. However, the extent to which people depend on SNS and their different reasons for using these services must be considered, given that today\u0027s rumors are largely disseminated through SNSs including Facebook, Twitter, and other online messaging services (Doerr et al., 2012) . Examining this issue can provide a footstep in the rumor study by answering how people\u0027s different dependencies on SNS function in the accuracy-oriented information seeking of false messages.",

We expect that the findings from this research will contribute to better understanding of the interactions between credibility of false rumors and SNS dependency on accuracy-oriented information seeking in the context of rumor communication. Exploring the mechanisms underlying the information seeking, in turn, can help curb the detrimental impact of the false rumors during hazard situations. The current research can be a groundwork for seeking out the relationship between false rumors beliefs, SNS dependency, and information seeking behaviors under risky situations. Furthermore, by differentiating the meaning of information seeking with accuracy-orientated information seeking, this research can open the venue to develop discussions on information seeking.",
