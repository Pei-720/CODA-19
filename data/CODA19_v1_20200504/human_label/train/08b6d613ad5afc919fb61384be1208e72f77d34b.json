H830A alteration (RIG-I(H830A)) restored binding of N 1 -2 0 O-methylated pppRNA. Consequently, endogenous mRNA activated the RIG-I(H830A) mutant but not wild-type RIG-I. Similarly, knockdown of the endogenous N 1 -2 0 O-methyltransferase led to considerable RIG-I stimulation in the absence of exogenous stimuli. Studies involving yellow-fever-virus-encoded 2 0 O-methyltransferase and RIG-I(H830A) revealed that viruses exploit this mechanism to escape RIG-I.
