      "original_text": "Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is one of the primary causes of severe pulmonary hypertension. In order to identify long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that may be involved in the development of CTEPH, comprehensive lncRNA and messenger RNA (mRNA) profiling of endothelial tissues from the pulmonary arteries of CTEPH patients was conducted with microarray analysis. Differential expression of 185 lncRNAs was observed in the CTEPH tissues compared with healthy control tissues. Further analysis identified 464 regulated enhancer-like lncRNAs and overlapping, antisense or nearby mRNA pairs. Coexpression networks were subsequently constructed and investigated. The expression levels of the lncRNAs, NR_036693, NR_027783, NR_033766 and NR_001284, were significantly altered. Gene ontology and pathway analysis demonstrated the potential role of lncRNAs in the regulation of central process, including inflammatory response, response to endogenous stimulus and antigen processing and presentation. The use of bioinformatics may help to uncover and analyze large quantities of data identified by microarray analyses, through rigorous experimental planning, statistical analysis and the collection of more comprehensive data regarding CTEPH. The results of the present study provided evidence which may be helpful in future studies on the diagnosis and management of CTEPH.",
