Human CCR4 + tumorbearing mice treated once with intravenous infusion of AAV8 virions encoding the h1567 (AAV8-h1567) minibody showed anti-tumor activity in vivo and increased survival. The AAV8-h1567 minibody notably increased the number of tumorinfiltrating Ly-6G + FccRIIIa(CD16A) + murine neutrophils in the tumor xenografts over that of AAV8-control minibody treated mice. Furthermore, in CCR4 + tumor-bearing mice co-treated with AAV8-h1567 minibody and infused with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), marked tumor infiltration of human CD16A + CD56 + NK cells was observed. The h1567 minibody also induced in vitro ADCC activity through both mouse neutrophils and human NK cells.",
