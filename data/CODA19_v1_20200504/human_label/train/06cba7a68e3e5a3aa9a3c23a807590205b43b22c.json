Immunopathol., In this report, we describe an in vitro culture method for feline bone marrow cells, which yields large numbers of quiescent macrophages after 14 days of culture. The bulk of the cultured cell population consists of macrophages as assessed by morphology, macrophage specific cytochemistry, and phagocytosis. The remaining cells were lymphocytes, bone marrow stromal cells, fibroblasts and occasional polymorphonuclear leukocytes. While resting cells produced no detectable interleukin 1, stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced the production of biologically active interleukin 1. After 6 h LPS stimulation, mRNA for tumor necrosis factor a and interleukin lfl was detectable. The absence of mRNA in unstimulated cells indicates cultured macrophages were not activated until stimulated by LPS or plastic adherence. This approach provides a useful means to measure potential modulatory effects by virus infections or other agents upon feline macrophage gene expression.
