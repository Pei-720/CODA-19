      "original_text": "A study was performed to evaluate porcine torovirus (PToV) seroprevalence and infection in three multi-site farms from the North-eastern region of Spain. Serum samples from 120 piglets and faecal samples from 36 piglets were longitudinally collected at 1, 3, 7, 11 and 15 weeks of age. Serum samples from their dams (n \u003d 30) were also taken 1-week postfarrowing. PToV antibodies in serum were monitored by ELISA, while viral infection was assessed by real-time RT-PCR in faeces. A high seroprevalence (about 100%) was observed in animals older than 11 weeks and in adult sows. Moreover, all 1-week-old animals were seropositive, indicating maternal antibody transference through colostrum. The antibody titers declined to close to or below the ELISA cut-off value by the age of weaning (3 weeks of age). Development of a significant antibody response to PToV occurred before 7 weeks of age in about 50% of piglets, and the remaining animals developed the response by weeks 11 or 15. These results indicate that PToV infection occurred soon after weaning. Although the prevalence of infection in suckling piglets varied among the studied farms, PToV prevalences in 7 and 11-week-old pigs were between 50-67% and 58-75%, respectively, in all farms. Sequencing results indicated that more than one PToV strains were circulating in the studied farms. Present data suggest that PToV was endemic on the studied farms, and provide new insights on the epidemiology of PToV.",
