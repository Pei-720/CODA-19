      "original_text": "The objective of this study was to elucidate the kinetics and magnitudes of speci®c IgA antibody responses in intestines of turkey poults infected with turkey coronavirus (TCV). Turkey poults were orally inoculated with TCVat 10 days of age. Intestinal segment cultures were administered for duodenum, jejunum, and ileum and the IgA antibody responses were analyzed at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 9 weeks post-infection (PI) in two different experiments. The kinetics of virus-speci®c IgA antibody responses in duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were similar: gradually increased from 1 week PI, reached the peak at 3 or 4 weeks PI, and declined afterward. The virus-speci®c IgA antibody responses in duodenum, jejunum, and ileum showed negative correlation with duration of TCV antigen in the corresponding locations of intestine with Spearman\u0027s correlation coef®cient of À0.85 p 0:034, À0.74 p 0:096, and À0.75 p 0:084, respectively. Moreover, the virus-speci®c IgA antibody responses in serum were positively correlated with that of duodenum coefficient 0:829; p 0:042, jejunum coefficient 0:829; p 0:042, and ileum coefficient 0:771; p 0:072 segment cultures, suggesting that the induction of speci®c IgA response in serum was predictive of an IgA response in intestine. The results indicate that intestinal mucosal IgA antibodies to TCV are elicited in turkeys following infection with TCV. The local mucosal antibodies may provide protective immunity for infected turkeys to recover from TCV infection. #",
