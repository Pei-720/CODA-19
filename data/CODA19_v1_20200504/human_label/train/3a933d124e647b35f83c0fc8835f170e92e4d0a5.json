Inhibitory effects of ribavirin alone or combined with human alpha interferon on feline infectious peritonitis virus replication in vitro. Vet. Microbiol., The antiviral activities of ribavirin (1-fl-D-ribofuranosyl-l,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide; virazole), either alone or in combination with recombinant human leukocyte (alpha) interferon (rHuIFN-a ), were evaluated against feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) in feline kidneycell cultures. The 50% inhibitory dose (ID~o) of ribavirin for uninfected, rapidly dividing cells was ~ 17 Bg ml-1 whereas the ID~o for FIPV was 2.5 #g ml-1. The therapeutic index ( TI ) of ribavirin (i.e. the ratio of the minimum cell-toxic dose to minimum virus-inhibitory dose) was 6.8. Although a dose-dependent inhibition of viral infectivity occurred at non-toxic doses, maximum antiviral effects ( \u003e 4 loglo reduction in FIPV ) occurred at cytotoxic doses.",
