The changes of the cases with normal level ()95 % ) or abnormal level (~95 % ) SaOz were observed dynamically. Results: In the 3rd-14th day of the therapeutic course, the percentage of patients with normal SaC2 in the ICWM group was higher than that in the WM group (OR \u003d 0. 5178, P--0. 0038), and this tendency was more evident in patients of the severe type (OR \u003d 0.18, P \u003d 0. 0001 ). However, the statistical significance of difference was only shown in patients for whom the ICWM treatment started in the early period after the onset (47 days after it, OR \u003d 0. 3803, P \u003d 0. 006), but not shown in those who received ICWM treatment later in the mid-late period of SARS (P~0.05).",
