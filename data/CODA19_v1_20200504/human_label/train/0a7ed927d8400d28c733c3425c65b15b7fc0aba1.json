Replication of the Kresse isolate was restricted at 32 and 37 °C as evidenced by progeny virus, virus polypeptide and viral DNA synthesis, but not at 39 °C. In contrast, replication of KBSH was restricted at 39 °C, but not at 37 or 32 °C. Findings from this study support the contention that replication of KBSH and Kresse isolates are temperature dependent.",

      "original_text": "Porcine parvovirus (PPV), a member of the autonomously replicating parvoviruses, causes reproductive failure in swine [ 14, 18] . Isolates of PPV have been made from a variety of sources including porcine tissues, both diseased and non-diseased [3, 13, 17, 18] and as cell culture contaminants [10] . The pathogenicity of four isolates, NADL-8, NADL-2, KBSH and Kresse, in swine have been extensively compared in our laboratory [4, 21-23] as well as in other laboratories [17, 25] . NADL-8 and NADL-2 were originally isolated from a mummified fetus [20] and normal pig leukocytes [19] , respectively. Both NADL-8 and NADL-2 caused fetal infection and death when injected in utero, prior to immunocompetency, but higher concentrations of inoculum and longer incubation periods were required for NADL-2 to show these pathogenic effects [25] . KBSH was originally isolated from the human KB cell line where it had been passaged at least 300 times [10J. While KBSH is antigenically and molecularly related to prototype PPV strains such as 23] , KBSH fails to replicate in swine fetuses following in utero inoculation [23] . The Kresse isolate originated from skin lesions of young swine [17] . This virus isolate caused fetal death both before and after immunocompetency [4] , in contrast to NADL-8 which was pathogenic only before immunocompetency [19] .",
