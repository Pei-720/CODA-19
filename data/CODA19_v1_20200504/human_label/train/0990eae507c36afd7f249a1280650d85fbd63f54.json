      "original_text": "The following six methods for detecting rotavirus in human faecal samples were compared: electron microscopy, immune electron microscopy, immunofluoreseence in cell culture, two enzyme immunoassays (Rotazyme, Enzygnost) and a latex agglutination test (Rotalex). Specimens were collected from 112 children with diarrhoea. The relative sensitivities of the different assays for human rotavirus were as follows: electron microscopy, 84%; immunofluorescence, 86 %; Rotalex, 88 %; Rotazyme, 89 %; immune electron microscopy, 93 %; Enzygnost, 98 %. According to our findings Enzygnost is the most sensitive method, but Rotalex is more valuable for screening a small number of faecal samples. No false-positive results were observed in the two enzyme immunoassays or in Rotalex.",
