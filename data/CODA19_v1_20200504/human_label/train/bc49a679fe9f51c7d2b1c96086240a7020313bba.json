      "original_text": "Proteolytic enzymes play essential metabolic and regulatory functions in many biological processes and also offer a wide range of biotechnological applications. Because of their essential roles, their proteolytic activity needs to be tightly regulated. Therefore, small molecules and proteins that inhibit proteases can be versatile tools in the fields of medicine, agriculture and biotechnology. In medicine, protease inhibitors can be used as diagnostic or therapeutic agents for viral, bacterial, fungal and parasitic diseases as well as for treating cancer and immunological, neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases. They can be involved in crop protection against plant pathogens and herbivorous pests as well as against abiotic stress such as drought. Furthermore, protease inhibitors are indispensable in protein purification procedures to prevent undesired proteolysis during heterologous expression or protein extraction. They are also valuable tools for simple and effective purification of proteases, using affinity chromatography. Because there are such a large number and diversity of proteases in prokaryotes, yeasts, filamentous fungi and mushrooms, we can expect them to be a rich source of protease inhibitors as well.",
