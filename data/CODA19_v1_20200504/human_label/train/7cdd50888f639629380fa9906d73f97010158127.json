T cell immunoglobulin mucin domain-1 (TIM-1) is a phosphatidylserine (PS) 28 receptor, mediating filovirus entry into cells through interactions with PS on virions. TIM-1 29 expression has been implicated in Ebola virus (EBOV) pathogenesis; however, it remains 30 unclear whether this is due to TIM-1 serving as a filovirus receptor in vivo or, as others have 31 suggested, TIM-1 induces a cytokine storm elicited by T cell/virion interactions. Here, we use a 32 BSL2 model virus that expresses EBOV glycoprotein and demonstrate the importance of TIM-1 33 as a virus receptor late during in vivo infection. 34",
