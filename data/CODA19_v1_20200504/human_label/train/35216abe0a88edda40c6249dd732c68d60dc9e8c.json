      "original_text": "The potential for environmental and occupational exposures of populations to nanomaterials (NMs) has fostered concerns of associated adverse health effects, with a particular emphasis on pulmonary injury and disease. Many studies have revealed that several types of NMs can evoke a variety of biological responses, such as pulmonary inflammation and oxidative stress, which contribute to allergy, fibrosis, and granuloma formation. Less attention has been paid to health effects that may result from exposure to NMs and additional stressors such as pathogens, with a particular focus on susceptibility to viral infection. This chapter will summarize the current body of literature related to NMs and viral exposures with a primary focus on immune modulation. A summary of the studies performed and major findings to date will be discussed, highlighting proposed molecular mechanisms behind NM-driven host susceptibility, challenges, limitations, and future research needs. Specific mechanisms discussed include direct interaction between NMs and biological molecules, activation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and related signaling pathways, production of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammasome activation, and modulation of lipid signaling networks.",
