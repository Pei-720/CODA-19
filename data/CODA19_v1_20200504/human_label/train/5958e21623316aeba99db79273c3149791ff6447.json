      "original_text": "Exosomes are 40-100 nm membrane vesicles secreted into the extracellular space by numerous cell types. These structures can be isolated from body fluids including urine and plasma. Exosomes contain proteins, mRNAs, miRNAs, and signaling molecules that reflect the physiological state of their cells of origin and consequently provide a rich source of potential biomarker molecules. Aside from diagnostic uses, exosome-mediated transfer of proteins, mRNAs, miRNAs, and signaling molecules offer the promise that they may be used for therapeutic purposes. In this review, we integrate new knowledge about exosomes from outside the field of nephrology with recent progress by renal researchers in order to provide a basis for speculation about how the study of exosomes may affect the fields of nephrology and renal physiology in the next few years.",
