      "original_text": "Three types of immunochromatographic assays (ICAs) were designed to detect anti-feline coronavirus (FCoV) antibodies. Recombinant FCoV nucleocapsid protein (rNP) was used as a conjugate or test line in all 3 ICA kits ( CJ IgG/ T NP, CJ NP/ T NP, and CJ NP/ T PA). All three ICA kits were capable of detecting anti-FCoV antibodies; however, non-specific positive reactions of anti-FCoV antibody-negative plasma samples with the test line were observed in 2 ICA kits ( CJ IgG/ T NP and CJ NP/ T NP), in which rNP was used as the test line. On the other hand, the specific detection of anti-FCoV antibodies was possible in all plasma, serum, whole blood, and ascitic fluid samples using the ICA kit with protein A blotted as the test line ( CJ NP/ T PA). In addition, the specificity and sensitivity of ICA ( CJ NP/ T PA) were equivalent to those of the reference ELISA. The development of simple antibody test methods using the principle of ICA ( CJ NP/ T PA) for other coronavirus and feline viral infections is expected in the future.",
