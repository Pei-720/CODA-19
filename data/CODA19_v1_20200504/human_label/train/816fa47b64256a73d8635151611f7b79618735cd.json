The barrier that consists of mucous, defensins, and immunoglobulin A is a \"kill zone\" to prevent microbial invasion of the GI epithelium. The enterocytes are key cells that maintain the \"kill zone\" and respond to metabolites and microbial components from the lumen and signals from immune cells to maintain tight junctions and prevent \"leaky gut.\" Passive enteric immunity is essential for disease protection of the neonate; antiinflammatory enteric response is essential disease protection for the growing and adult animal. Direct-fed microbials, including nutraceuticals, prebiotics, probiotics, and other dietary supplements, affect commensal \"homeostasis\" and mucosa immunity to maintain GI health.",
