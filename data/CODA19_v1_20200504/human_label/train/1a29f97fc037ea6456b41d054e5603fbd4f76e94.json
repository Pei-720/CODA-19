      "original_text": "Our study demonstrates the repeated isolation of vaccine-derived Newcastle disease viruses from different species of wild birds across four continents from 1997 through 2014. The data indicate that at least 17 species from ten avian orders occupying different habitats excrete vaccine-derived Newcastle disease viruses. The most frequently reported isolates were detected among individuals in the order Columbiformes (n \u003d 23), followed in frequency by the order Anseriformes (n \u003d 13). Samples were isolated from both free-ranging (n \u003d 47) and wild birds kept in captivity (n \u003d 7). The number of recovered vaccine-derived viruses corresponded with the most widely utilized vaccines, LaSota (n \u003d 28) and Hitchner B1 (n \u003d 19). Other detected vaccine-derived viruses resembled the PHY-LMV2 and V4 vaccines, with five and two cases, respectively. These results and the ubiquitous and synanthropic nature of wild pigeons highlight their potential role as indicator species for the presence of Newcastle disease virus of low virulence in the environment. The reverse spillover of live agents from domestic animals to wildlife as a result of the expansion of livestock industries employing massive amounts of live virus vaccines represent an underappreciated and poorly studied effect of human activity on wildlife.",

For the purpose of this paper we define \"spillover or spillover of live vaccines\" as the unintended transmission of live poultry vaccine viruses from domestic, gallinaceous poultry into non-target birds.
