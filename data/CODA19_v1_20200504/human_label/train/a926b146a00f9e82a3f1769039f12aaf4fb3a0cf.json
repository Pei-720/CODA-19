A kinetic enzymatic resolution generated an enantiopure aminocyclopentenol and Pd(0)-mediated decarboxylative allylations of allyl 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl malonates were used to install the 4 0 -hydroxyethyl groups. Late stage derivatization gave access to the cyclopropylamine analogs, (À)-5 0 -homoabacavir, and (þ)-epi-4 0 -homoabacavir. All carbonucleoside target molecules were evaluated for antiviral activity.",
