      "original_text": "Various 5-substituted-2-(1-((diethylamino)methyl)-2-oxoindolin-3-ylidene)hydrazinecarbothioamide (4a, b) and 5-substituted-2-(1-((diethylamino)methyl)-2-oxoindolin-3-ylidene)-N-(phenyl-4-substituted)hydrazinecarbothioamide (5a-h) derivatives were synthesized. The compounds were screened for cytotoxicity against human HeLa and CEM T-lymphocytes as well as murine L1210 cells. The compounds were also screened for b-lactamase inhibitory activity, antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal activity against various strains of microorganisms. Several of these compounds were endowed with low micromolar 50 %cytostatic concentration (IC 50 ) values, and some were virtually equally potent as melphalan. The most potent inhibitors against the murine leukemia cells (L1210) were also the most inhibitory against human T-lymphocyte (CEM) tumor cells. Derivative 2-(1-((diethylamino) methyl)-2-oxoindolin-3-ylidene)-N-(4-methoxyphenyl)hydrazinecarbothioamide 5c emerged as the most potent cytostatic compound among the tested compounds. Derivatives 4b, 5a, 5b, and 5d showed antiviral activity against HEL cell cultures (IC 50 11-20 lM). Moderate antimicrobial activity was observed for all derivatives. The encouraging cytostatic and antiviral activity data provide an adequate rationale for further modification of these molecular scaffolds.",
