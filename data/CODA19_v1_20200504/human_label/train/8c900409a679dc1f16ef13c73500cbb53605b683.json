      "original_text": "The severity and outcome of respiratory viral infections is partially determined by the cellular 9 response mounted by infected lung epithelial cells. Disease prevention and treatment is dependent on our 10 understanding of the shared and unique responses elicited by diverse viruses, yet few studies compare host 11 responses to different viruses while controlling other experimental parameters. We used microarray analysis 12 to compare changes in gene expression of murine lung epithelial cells infected individually by three respiratory 13 viruses causing mild (rhinovirus, RV1B), moderate (coronavirus, MHV-1), and severe (influenza A virus, 14 PR8) disease in mice. RV1B infection caused numerous gene expression changes, but the differential effect 15 peaked at 12 hours post-infection. PR8 altered an intermediate number of genes whose expression continued 16 to change through 24 hours. MHV-1 had comparatively few effects on host gene expression. The viruses 17 elicited highly overlapping responses in antiviral genes, though MHV-1 induced a lower type I interferon 18 response than the other two viruses. Signature genes were identified for each virus and included host defense 19 genes for PR8, tissue remodeling genes for RV1B, and transcription factors for MHV-1. Our comparative 20 approach identified universal and specific transcriptional signatures of virus infection that can be used to 21 discover mechanisms of pathogenesis in the respiratory tract.",
