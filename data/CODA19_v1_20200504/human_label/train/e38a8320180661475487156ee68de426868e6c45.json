The EL Ca 2+ store releases Ca 2+ through a variety of Ca 2+ -permeable channels, including Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) Mucolipin 1-3 (TRPML1-3) and two-pore channels 1-2 (TPC1-2), whereas EL Ca 2+ refilling is sustained by the proton gradient across the EL membrane and/or by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

An increase in intracellular Ca 2+ concentration ([Ca 2+ ] i ) is produced by the opening of Ca 2+ -permeable channels, which are located either on the PM or on the membrane of endogenous organelles, in response to extracellular stimulation. Typically, extracellular agonists, including growth factors, cytokines, neurotransmitters and hormones, bind to their specific tyrosine kinase receptors (TKRs) or G q -protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), thereby recruiting, respectively, phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) and PLCβ, which in turn cleave phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP 2 ) into inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP 3 ) and diacyl-glycerol (DAG) [1]. Subsequently, InsP 3 primes immobile InsP 3 receptors (InsP 3 Rs), which reside at juxtaposed endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-PM junctions, to respond to cytosolic Ca 2+ according to the process of Ca 2+ -induced Ca 2+ release (CICR), which enables to spatially restricted Ca 2+ signals to spread across the cytoplasm as a regenerative Ca 2+ wave [5, 6] . Moreover, InsP 3 -induced Ca 2+ release can be further amplified by the recruitment of adjoining ryanodine receptors (RyRs), which are also sensitive to CICR [7] . Additionally, InsP 3 -induced Ca 2+ release causes a large drop in the ER Ca 2+ concentration ([Ca 2+ ] ER ) which triggers a signaling cascade leading to the opening of a Ca 2+ -permeable pathway on the PM, known as store-operated Ca 2+ entry (SOCE) [8, 9] . SOCE is activated when ER Ca 2+ dissociates from the luminal EF hands domain of STIM1 (Stromal Interaction Molecule 1), the sensor of [Ca 2+ ] ER , which undergoes a dramatic conformational change and sub-cellular repositioning. The depletion of ER Ca 2+ induces STIM1 to oligomerize and translocate from its reticular location in the bulk ER to specialized ER-PM junctions (≈20 nm) where it forms STIM1 puncta and interacts with the pore-forming subunit of store-operated channels (SOCs), Orai1 [8] . The dynamic interplay between InsP 3 -induced ER Ca 2+ release and SOCE gives raise to distinct spatio-temporally complex Ca 2+ signatures, ranging from local Ca 2+ puffs to repetitive global Ca 2+ oscillations, that selectively regulate different cellular functions [2, 10, 11] .",
