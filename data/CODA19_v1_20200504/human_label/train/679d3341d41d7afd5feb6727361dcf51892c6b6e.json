For this analysis, \"elective cesarean delivery\" was defined as any cesarean delivery, regardless of gestational age, without labor and with duration of ruptured membranes of less than 5 minutes. Nonelective cesarean deliveries were those performed after the onset of labor, rupture of membranes, or both. Vaginal delivery included normal spontaneous and instrument deliveries. Associations between mode of delivery and infant respiratory morbidity were assessed using χ 2 or Fisher\u0027s exact test. Adjusted odds of respiratory distress syndrome by delivery mode were assessed using multivariable logistic regression.",
