      "original_text": "In this review, we give an overview of the effects of photoactivated TiO 2 on microorganisms. The activity has been shown to be capable of killing a wide range of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, filamentous and unicellular fungi, algae, protozoa, mammalian viruses and bacteriophage. Resting stages, particularly bacterial endospores, fungal spores and protozoan cysts, are generally more resistant than the vegetative forms, possibly due to the increased cell wall thickness. The killing mechanism involves degradation of the cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane due to the production of reactive oxygen species such as hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen peroxide. This initially leads to leakage of cellular contents then cell lysis and may be followed by complete mineralisation of the organism. Killing is most efficient when there is close contact between the organisms and the TiO 2 catalyst. The killing activity is enhanced by the presence of other antimicrobial agents such as Cu and Ag.",
