      "original_text": "14 Zika virus is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus of the family Flaviviridae, which has 15 recently undergone a rapid expansion among humans in the Western Hemisphere. Here, we report 16 a high-resolution map of ribosomal occupancy of the Zika virus genome during infection of 17 mammalian and insect cells, obtained by ribosome profiling. In contrast to some other flaviviruses 18 such as West Nile, we find no evidence for substantial frameshift-induced ribosomal drop-off 19 during translation of the viral polyprotein, indicating that Zika virus must use alternative 20 mechanisms to downregulate levels of catalytically active viral polymerase. We also show that 21 high levels of ribosome-protected fragments map in-frame to two previously overlooked upstream 22 open reading frames (uORFs) initiating at CUG and UUG codons, with likely consequences for 23 the efficiency of polyprotein expression. Curiously, in African isolates of Zika virus, the two 24 uORFs are fused in-frame into a single uORF. A parallel RNA-Seq analysis reveals the 5\u0027 end 25 .
