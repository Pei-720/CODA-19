      "original_text": "Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is the essential infectious agent responsible for causing porcine circovirus-associated diseases in pigs. To date, eleven RNAs and five viral proteins of PCV2 have been detected. Here, we identified a novel viral gene within the PCV2 genome, termed ORF5, that exists at both the transcriptional and translational level during productive infection of PCV2 in porcine alveolar macrophages 3D4/2 (PAMs). Northern blot analysis was used to demonstrate that the ORF5 gene measures 180 bp in length and overlaps completely with ORF1 when read in the same direction. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to show that the ORF5 protein is not essential for PCV2 replication. To investigate the biological functions of the novel protein, we constructed a recombinant eukaryotic expression plasmid capable of expressing PCV2 ORF5. The results show that the GFP-tagged PCV2 ORF5 protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is degraded via the proteasome, inhibits PAM growth and prolongs the S-phase of the cell cycle. Further studies show that the GFP-tagged PCV2 ORF5 protein induces ER stress and activates NF-κB, which was further confirmed by a significant upregulation in IL-6, IL-8 and COX-2 expression. In addition, five cellular proteins (GPNMB, CYP1A1, YWHAB, ZNF511 and SRSF3) were found to interact with ORF5 via yeast two-hybrid assay. These findings provide novel information on the identification and functional analysis of the PCV2 ORF5 protein and are likely to be of benefit in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of PCV2 pathogenicity. However, additional experiments are needed to validate the expression and function of the ORF5 protein during PCV2 infection in vitro before any definitive conclusion can be drawn.",

Although the nucleotide homology within individual isolates of either PCV1 or PCV2 is over 90%, the homology between PCV1 and PCV2 as serotypes is only 68% to 76% [19, 21] . This diversity may be responsible for the differences in pathogenicity or virulence observed for these serotypes. The virus was predicted to possess 11 overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) [19], of which four have been characterized in detail in replicating PCV2. On the viral strand, there is the ORF1 (nucleotides 51-995) gene, which encodes the Rep and Rep\u0027 proteins essential for PCV2 replication [22]. On the complementary strand, there are the ORF2 (nucleotides 1735-1034), ORF3 (nucleotides 671-357) and ORF4 (nucleotides 565-386) genes, which encode the capsid protein [23], apoptotic protein [21] and controversial anti-apoptotic protein, respectively [24-25]. Previous transcriptional analysis conducted during productive PCV2 infection of porcine kidney cells measured nine unique PCV2-specific RNA transcripts (designated-CR, Rep, Rep 0 , Rep3a, Rep3b, Rep3c, NS515, NS672, and NS0) [26]; however, only CR, Rep and Rep 0 transcripts were proven capable of translation into functional proteins [22, [26] [27] . In contrast, ORF3 and ORF4 transcripts, which are not included in the above nine RNAs, were subsequently confirmed to play important roles in the pathogenesis of PCV2; ORF3-deficient PCV2 is attenuated in its natural host [28] , and ORF4-deficient PCV2 induces a higher viral load and more severe microscopic lesions in the spleen during early stages of infection in mice [24] . Collectively, these research findings indicate that PCV2 pathogenesis is both complicated and multigenic and that the individual viral proteins encoded by ORF2, ORF3 or ORF4 are insufficient in determining pathogenicity. Previous computational analysis has revealed that the PCV2 genome contains at least seven ORFs with the potential to encode proteins \u003e 5 kDa [29] ; to date, four have been identified. However, it has not yet been determined whether the three additional predicted proteins exist or whether there are still other viral proteins encoded by PCV2 that control its pathogenicity.",
