      "original_text": "The objective of this study was to investigate the factors that influence calf health and survival in Charolais cattle. Data from 2,740 calves, originating from 16 French farms and observed from birth until 30 d of age, were analyzed using models that took account of direct genetic, maternal genetic, and common environmental effects. Both direct and maternal genetic parameters were estimated for birth weight (BW), calving ease (CE), neonatal vitality (NV), survival at 30 d (Surv), and umbilical infection and diarrhea at different ages (0 to 5 d: Umb1 and Diar1; 6 to 20 d: Umb2 and Diar2; and 21 to 30 d: Umb3 and Diar3). The heritability values for direct and maternal genetic effects were, 0.026 (SE \u003d 0.027) and 0.096 (SE \u003d 0.042) for Surv, 0.280 (SE \u003d 0.063) and 0.063 (SE \u003d 0.038) for BW, 0.129 (SE \u003d 0.041) and 0 for CE, 0.073 (SE \u003d 0.035) and 0 for NV, 0.071 (SE \u003d 0.038) and 0.017 (SE \u003d 0.026) for Umb1, 0 and 0.082 (SE \u003d 0.029) for Umb2, 0 and 0.044 (SE \u003d 0.030) for Diar1, 0.016 (SE \u003d 0.022) and 0.012 (SE \u003d 0.026) for Diar2, and 0.016 (SE \u003d 0.028) and 0 for Diar3, respectively. Significant genetic variability in beef cattle was thus revealed for five calf health traits: NV, Surv, Diar1, Umb1, and",
