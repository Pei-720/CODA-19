The protection was ascribed to d7EB cell interaction with lung resident CD11b؉ cells, and was correlated with the ability of d7EB cells to reduce it also reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines by CD11؉ cells, and to endothelial NO synthase-derived NO by d7EB cells, leading to inhibition of inducible macrophage-type NO synthase activation in CD11b؉ cells. The protective progenitor cells were positive for the endothelial and hematopoietic lineage marker angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Only the ACE؉ fraction modulated the proinflammatory profile of CD11b؉ cells and reduced mortality in septic mice. In contrast to the nonprotective ACE-cell fraction, the ACE؉ cell fraction also produced NO. These findings suggest that an ACE؉ subset of human embryonic stem cell-derived progenitor cells has a highly specialized anti-inflammatory function that ameliorates sepsis-induced lung inflammation and reduces mortality.",
