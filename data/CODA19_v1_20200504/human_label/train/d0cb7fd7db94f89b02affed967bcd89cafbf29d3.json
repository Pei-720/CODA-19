At admission she had shortness of breath and refused to drink. The patient\u0027s temperature was 39 °C, the respiratory rate was 50 breaths/min with oxygen saturation of 96% and her pulse was 177 beats/min. Upon auscultation bilateral prolonged expirium and end-expiratory wheezing was found. A chest radiograph showed the typical features of bronchiolitis. The child was treated with salbutamol and ipratropium at the first day, followed by the use of salbutamol only for 5 days.",
