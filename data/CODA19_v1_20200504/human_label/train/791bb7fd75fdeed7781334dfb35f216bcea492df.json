There is an increasing use of carbamates in medicinal chemistry and many derivatives are specifically designed to make drug−target interactions through their carbamate moiety. In this Perspective, we present properties and stabilities of carbamates, reagents and chemical methodologies for the synthesis of carbamates, and recent applications of carbamates in drug design and medicinal chemistry.",
