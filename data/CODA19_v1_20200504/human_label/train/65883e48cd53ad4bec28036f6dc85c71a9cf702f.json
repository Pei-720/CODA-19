      "original_text": "The global burden of morbidity and mortality associated with communicable diseases is nearly three times that of cancer and 70% higher than that of cardiovascular disease [1] . Much of the infectious disease burden is caused by diseases that have a long history in human populations, such as measles, influenza, and pertussis. In recent years, additional disease burden has emerged from outbreaks of HIV, Chikungunya, Zika virus, Ebola virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome, coronavirus, Nipah virus, and Lassa fever, underscoring the continued vulnerability of human populations to novel and re-emerging threats. Mathematical models of infectious disease can be used to understand and predict epidemiological trajectories of outbreaks; they can then be applied to optimize strategies for mitigating disease transmission. These models incorporate pertinent environmental factors, such as seasonal fluctuations, that affect survival or activity of pathogens and their vectors. They can also address complexities of host behavioral change, including local and global human societal changes, health policy, clinical trial design, and resource allocation, which have been increasingly guided by modeling studies.",
