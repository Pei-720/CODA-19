The sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility and clinical performance of mOTNRT-PCR were evaluated and compared with individual real time PCR (RT-qPCR) assay using clinical samples. The analytical sensitivity of mOTNRT-PCR assay was 5 copies/reaction for RSV, HRV and HMPV, respectively, and no cross-reaction with other common respiratory viruses was observed. The coefficients of variation (CV) of intra-assay and inter-assay were between 0.51 to 3.67%. Of 398 nasopharyngeal aspirates samples tested, 109 (27.39%), 150 (37.69%) and 44 (11.06%) were positive for RSV, HRV and HMPV, respectively, whereas 95 (23.87%), 137 (34.42%) and 38 (9.55%) were positive for RSV, HRV and HMPV, respectively, by individual RT-qPCR assay. Thirty three samples that were positive by mOTNRT-PCR but negative by RT-qPCR were confirmed as true positives by sequencing using reported traditional two-step nested PCR assay. Conclusion: mOTNRT-PCR assay reveals extremely higher sensitivity than that of RT-qPCR assay for detecting RSV, HRV and HMPV in clinical settings.",
