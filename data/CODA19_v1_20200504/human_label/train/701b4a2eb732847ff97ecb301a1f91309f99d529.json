      "original_text": "A systemic disease of domestic ferrets characterized by pyogranulomatous inflammation was first recognized in Europe and the United States in 2002. The disease closely resembled feline infectious peritonitis and subsequently has been shown to be associated with ferret systemic coronavirus (FRSCV). A definitive laboratory diagnosis of this disease is typically based on a combination of immunohistochemistry (IHC) and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction tests to detect FRSCV in granulomatous lesions. In 2010, this feline infectious peritonitis-like disease was first identified in a laboratory ferret in Japan, and laboratory confirmation of the clinical diagnosis was limited to IHC. This report describes 2 cases of systemic coronavirus-associated disease in ferrets presented to Japanese veterinary hospitals. Both presented with pyogranulomatous inflammation in the abdominal cavity, and both cases tested positive for coronavirus antigen by IHC. In 1 case, for which unfixed tissues were available, FRSCV RNA was detected by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in the affected tissues.",
