The patients in the progression group were significantly older than those in the disease improvement/stabilization group (66 [51, 70] years vs. 37 [32, 41] years, U \u003d4.932, P \u003d0.001). The progression group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a history of smoking than the improvement/stabilization group (27.3% vs. 3.0%,  2 \u003d9.291, P \u003d0.018).
