      "original_text": "Lipopolysaccharides, the major molecules in the outer membrane of Escherichia coli, affect the behavior of bacteria including outer membrane permeability, but its influence on lycopene production in E. coli has never been reported. In this study, the effects of lipopolysaccharides with different structures on lycopene biosynthesis were investigated. Firstly, the heterogenous crtEBI operon were overexpressed in 10 LPS mutant strains of E. coli W3110 (ΔwaaC, ΔwaaF, ΔwaaY, ΔwaaG, ΔwaaR, ΔwaaO, ΔwaaU, ΔwaaP, ΔwaaY and ΔwaaB), and their ability to produce lycopene were compared. ΔwaaC/pWSK29-crtEBI, ΔwaaF/pWSK29-crtEBI and ΔwaaY/pWSK29-crtEBI produced 4.19, 4.20, and 3.81 mg/g lycopene, respectively, while the control W3110/pWSK29-crtEBI produced 3.71 mg/g lycopene; the other strains produced less lycopene than the control. In order to enhance lycopene production, genes dxr, dxr, ispA, and idi were overexpressed in ΔwaaC/pWSK29-crtEBI, ΔwaaF/pWSK29-crtEBI individually or in combination, and the lycopene production in each strain was analyzed. The maximum yield of 5.39 mg/g was achieved in ΔwaaC/pWSK29-crtEBI-SRA, which is 142% higher than that in W3110/pWSK29-crtEBI. The results indicate that the length of lipopolysaccharide affects lycopene biosynthesis in E. coli, and the shorter lipopolysaccharide and higher outer membrane permeability might be beneficial to lycopene biosynthesis.",
