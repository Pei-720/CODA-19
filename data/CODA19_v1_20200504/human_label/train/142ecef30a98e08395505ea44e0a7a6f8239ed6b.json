      "original_text": "TiO 2 photocatalysts were prepared and coated on surfaces. Ultrathin TiO 2 coatings were obtained by wash-coating and screen-printing techniques. The latter provides films of excellent adhesion that could tolerate washing under water jet. The scratch-proof coatings were characterized, and X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and N 2 physisorption indicated that the addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG) not only improved the coating properties of TiO 2 but also served as poragen to produce high surface area, mesoporous TiO 2 . The coated TiO 2 displayed better activity than the commercial P25 TiO 2 for photocatalytic oxidation of ethylene, ethanol, acetaldehyde, isopropanol and acetone. The catalyst also exhibited excellent bactericidal, fungicidal and virucidal activities against a wide variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, fungal spores and T2 bacterial phage. A simple photoreactor with tangential air flow was designed and tested in a chamber, before incorporating in a prototype air purifier. The study showed that there is good agreement between laboratory catalyst reaction data (i.e., 110 mmol h −1 for acetone) and the prototype test results (69 mmol h −1 ).",
