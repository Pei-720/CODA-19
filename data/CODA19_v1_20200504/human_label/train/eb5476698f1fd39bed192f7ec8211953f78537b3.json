PCR fragments amplified from these constructs and containing the Firefly luciferase ORF fused to 5ʼ-UTRs of β-globin, β-actin, LINE-1, HCV IRES or CrPV IRES under the control of SP6 promoter was inserted to pUC18 plasmid digested by HindIII and EcoRI to generate pUCβglo, pUCβact and pUCL1, and by PstI and EcoRI to generate pUCHCV and pUCCrPV. Vectors for in vivo expression of monocistronic mRNAs containing Firefly luciferase ORF fused to 5ʼ-UTRs of β-globin, β-actin and LINE-1 were prepared by insertion of PCR fragment containing respective 5ʼ-UTRs to pGL3R-EMCV digested by AflII and NcoI to remove upstream Renilla luciferase ORF and EMCV IRES. Plasmid pCrPV-VHLM was constructed by insertion of T7 promoter, CrPV IRES nucleotides 6028 to 6216 followed by a short ORF encoding Val-His-Leu-Met tripeptide, UAA stop codon and 100 nt random sequence taken from β-glucuronidase (GUS) gene, into the pUC18 vector.
