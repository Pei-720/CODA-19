There are now several molecular assays available, cleared by the Food and Drug Administration, which differ with respect to the viruses detected, instrumentation, throughput, hands-on time, the need for separate nucleic acid extraction, and sensitivity for certain groups of viruses. Issues associated with molecular tests for respiratory viruses include: possible falsenegative results due to sequence variants; the inability of many assays to discriminate rhinoviruses from enteroviruses; the ability to detect viral nucleic acids in asymptomatic individuals; and the increased prevalence of coinfections.",
