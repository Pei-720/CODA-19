Among other potential pathogens, we 55 identified one novel orthobunyavirus, tentatively named Nyangole virus, from the blood of a 56 child diagnosed with malaria and pneumonia, and Bwamba orthobunyavirus in the nasopharynx 57 of a child with rash and sepsis. We also identified two novel human rhinovirus C species. 58 59 Conclusions: This exploratory pilot study demonstrates the utility of mNGS and the IDseq 60 platform for defining the molecular landscape of febrile infectious diseases in resource limited 61 areas. These methods, supported by a robust data analysis and sharing platform, offer a new tool 62 for the surveillance, diagnosis, and ultimately treatment and prevention of infectious diseases. 63",
