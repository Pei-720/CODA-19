Glial cell cultures were prepared from newborn syngeneic (C57B1/6J) and allogeneic (DBA/2) mouse brains. G1ial cultures 1-4 weeks of age were able to stimulate a-Class I-specific clones. No stimulation of a-Class II or a-background clones was noted. Incubation of glial cells with supernatants from cultures of alloantigen-activated spleen cells (C57B1/6J-anti-DBA/2) resulted in a decreased ability of glial cells to stimulate a-Class I responses. In contrast supernatant-treated cultures acquired the capacity to stimulate a-Class II-specific clones. No responses were noted in clones responsive to non-MHC antigens. The ability to stimulate a-Class II-specific clones was most prominent with bne-week-old glial cultures and was lost by four weeks of culture. The increased susceptibility of younger glial 226 cultures to the modulatory effects of lymphokines from activated T cells may be a factor in the increased susceptibility of the immature central nervous system to persistent viral infections and the development of autoimmune phenomena.",
