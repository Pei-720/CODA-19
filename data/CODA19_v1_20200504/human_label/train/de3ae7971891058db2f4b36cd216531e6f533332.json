      "original_text": "The viral cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitope peptides presented by classical MHC-I 13 molecules require the assembly of a peptide-MHC-I-β2m (aka pMHC-I) trimolecular complex 14 for TCR recognition, which is the critical activation link for triggering antiviral T cell immunity. 15 Ursidae includes 5 genera and 8 species; however, research on T cell immunology in this family, 16 especially structural immunology, is lacking. In this study, the structure of the key trimolecular 17 complex pMHC-1 (aka pAime-128), which binds a peptide from canine distemper virus, was solved 18 for the first time using giant panda as a representative species of Ursidae. The structural 19 characteristics of the giant panda pMHC-I complex, including the unique pockets in the 20 peptide-binding groove (PBG), were analyzed in detail. Comparing the panda pMHC-I to others 21 in the bear family and extending the comparison to other mammals revealed distinct features. 22 Spriggs H, Dear PH, Briggs AW. 2008.
