      "original_text": "Coronaviruses devote more than three quarters of their coding capacity to encode two large polyproteins (1a and 1ab polyproteins), which are proteolytically processed into 15-16 mature, nonstructural replicase proteins (nsp1 to 16). These cleavage products are believed to play essential roles in replication of the giant RNA genome of ∼ 30 kb and transcription of a nested set of 5 to 9 subgenomic RNA species by a unique discontinuous transcription mechanism. In this report, one of these replicase proteins, nsp9 of the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is systematically studied using both biochemical and reverse genetic approaches. The results showed that substitution mutation of a conserved Gly (G98) residue in the C-terminal α-helix domain with an Asp greatly destabilized the IBV nsp9 homodimer and abolished its RNA-binding activity. Introduction of the same mutation into an infectious IBV clone system showed that the mutation totally abolishes the transcription of subgenomic RNA and no infectious virus could be recovered. Mutation of a semi-conserved Ile (I95) residue in the same region showed moderately destabilizing effect on the IBV nsp9 homodimer but minimal effect on its RNA-binding activity. Introduction of the mutation into the IBV infectious clone system showed recovery of a mutant virus with severe growth defects, supporting that dimerization is critical for the function of this replicase protein. Meanwhile, mutations of some positively charged residues in the β-barrel regions of the IBV nsp9 protein significantly reduced its RNA-binding activity, but with no obvious effect on dimerization of the protein. Introduction of these mutations into the viral genome showed only mild to moderate effects on the growth and infectivity of the rescued mutant viruses.",
