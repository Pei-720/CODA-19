The deliberate dissemination of a biological agent by many of these same mechanisms presents the latest challenge to public health. The deliberate dissemination will often be obvious; however, identifying the covert dissemination of a biological may present challenges. Nonetheless, a thorough investigation integrating epidemiologic data and molecular typing will help to differentiate between a naturally occurring disease outbreak and one resulting from an act of terrorism.",
