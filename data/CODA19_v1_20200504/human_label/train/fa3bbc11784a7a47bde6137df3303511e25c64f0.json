      "original_text": "The disialoganglioside GD3 (CD60 a) and its Oacetylated variants have previously been described as surface molecules of human T lymphocytes of the peripheral blood system. Here we report the expression of the 9-O-, and 7-O-acetylated disialoglycans of GD3 (CD60 b and CD60 c respectively) on human tonsillar lymphocytes. CD60 b and c are surface-expressed on activated germinal centre B cells and colocalize in raft-like structures on the cell surface together with the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase Lyn and Syk. Addition of CD60 b and c mAb together with anti-IgM/IL-4 to in vitro cultivated tonsillar B cells resulted in a costimulatory effect. During spontaneous and staurosporine-induced apoptosis a distinct population of activated annexin V+/CD60 b+/CD60 c-B cells was observed. CD60 b and c are also found on cells of the extrafollicular T cell area. On tonsillar T cells, CD60 b mAb had a costimulatory effect together with PHA while CD60 c mAb alone was sufficient to induce proliferation. In further contrast to B cells, during apoptosis a distinct CD60 b+ T cell subpopulation was not observed. Together, surfaceexpressed CD60 b and c are differently expressed on tonsillar B and T cells and may be involved in the regulation of activation and apoptosis of lymphocytes in secondary lymphatic tissue.",
