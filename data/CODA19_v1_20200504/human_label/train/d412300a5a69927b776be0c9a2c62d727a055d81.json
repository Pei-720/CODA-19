Langereis et al. introduce methodology, based on nidovirus lectins and enzymes, for in situ detection of distinct O-acetylated sialic acid species and demonstrate its applicability by exploring sialoglycan distribution in mammalian cells and tissues. SUMMARY Sialic acids (Sias), 9-carbon-backbone sugars, are among the most complex and versatile molecules of life. As terminal residues of glycans on proteins and lipids, Sias are key elements of glycotopes of both cellular and microbial lectins and thus act as important molecular tags in cell recognition and signaling events. Their functions in such interactions can be regulated by post-synthetic modifications, the most common of which is differential Sia-O-acetylation (O-Ac-Sias). The biology of O-Ac-Sias remains mostly unexplored, largely because of limitations associated with their specific in situ detection.",
