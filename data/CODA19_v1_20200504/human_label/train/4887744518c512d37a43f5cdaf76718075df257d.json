      "original_text": "Singapore, and the USA. Meeting sessions covered aspects of the epidemiology, diagnosis, molecular and structural biology, vaccine development, and antiviral drug discovery for emerging RNA viruses that are current threats in Africa and included flaviviruses (dengue and Zika), alphaviruses (chikungunya), coronaviruses, filoviruses (Ebola), influenza viruses, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Rift Valley fever Virus, Lassa virus, and others. Data were presented on recent flavivirus and/or chikungunyavirus outbreaks in Angola, Burkina Faso, and Mozambique. In addition, these viruses are endemic in many sub-Saharan countries. The TASW series on emerging viruses is unique in Africa and successful in promoting collaborations between researchers in Africa and other parts of the world, as well as among African scientists. This report summarizes the lectures held at the meeting and highlights advances in the field.",
