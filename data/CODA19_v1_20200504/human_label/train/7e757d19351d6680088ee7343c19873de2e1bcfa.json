Radioactive compounds were from Hartmann Analytic. Ribosomes from E. coli MRE 600, fMet-tRNA fMet , Leu-tRNA Leu , EF-Tu, EF-G, and initiation factors were prepared as described (2-5). tRNA Gly , tRNA Lys , tRNA Val were prepared from total E. coli tRNA by consecutive column chromatographies on Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare), Phenyl Sepharose (GE Healthcare), and DEAE Toyopearl (Tosoh Bioscience). Aminoacylated tRNAs were purified by reversed-phase HPLC on an RP-18 HPLC column (250 mm × 10.5 mm, Merck) equilibrated with buffer (20 mM ammonium acetate, pH 5.0, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 400 mM NaCl) using a gradient of 0%-15%) ethanol. Aa-tRNAs were precipitated with ethanol and dissolved in water; concentrations were determined photometrically by absorbance at 260 nm.",
