    "title": "Human Leukocyte Antigens A*3001 and A*3002 Show Distinct Peptide-Binding Patterns of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Protein TB10.4: Consequences for Immune Recognition ᰔ † Construction of HLA-A*3001 and HLA-A*3002 tetramers containing selected binding peptides from TB10.4, including a peptide which was shared among both alleles, QIMYNYPAM (TB10.4 3-11 ), allowed us to enumerate epitope-specific T cells in HLA-A*3001-and HLA-A*3002-typed patients with active TB. HLA-A*3001 and HLA-A*3002 major histocompatibility complex-peptide complexes were recognized in individuals with active TB, irrespective of their homozygous HLA-A*3001 or HLA-A*3002 genetic back- ground. The antigen-specific T cells exhibited the CD45RA ؉ CCR7 ؉ precursor phenotype and the inter- leukin-7 receptor (CD127), which were different from the phenotype and receptor exhibited by the parental CD8 ؉ T-cell population",

      "original_text": "High-tuberculosis (TB)-burden countries are located in sub-Saharan Africa. We examined the frequency of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, followed by recombinant expression of the most frequent HLA-A alleles, i.e., HLA-A*3001 and HLA-A*3002, to study differences in mycobacterial peptide presentation and CD8 ؉ T-cell recognition. We screened a peptide library (9-mer peptides with an 8-amino-acid overlap) for binding, affinity, and off-rate of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis-associated antigen TB10.4 and identified only three TB10.4 peptides with considerable binding to HLA-A*3001. In contrast, 22 peptides bound to HLA-A*3002. This reflects a marked difference in the binding preference between the two alleles, with A*3002 tolerating a more promiscuous peptide-binding pattern and A*3001 accommodating only a very selective peptide repertoire. Subsequent analysis of the affinity and off-rate of the binding peptides revealed a strong affinity (8 nM to 7 M) and moderate off-rate (20 min to 3 h) for both alleles.",
