      "original_text": "The unclassified bovine enteric calicivirus (BEC) is a new bovine enteric calicivirus that is different from bovine norovirus, and causes diarrhea and pathologies in the small intestine of calves. This virus includes Nebraska (NB)-and Newbury agent 1 (NA1)-like strains. The prevalence of this BEC and its genetic characterization has only been reported in the UK and the USA. This study examined the prevalence and genetic diversity of these BECs in diarrheic calves in South Korea. Among a total of 645 diarrheic fecal specimens obtained from 629 cattle herds, these unclassified BECs were detected in 59 (9.1%) diarrheic fecal samples from 57 herds (9.3%) by either RT-PCR or nested PCR. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses of the partial RdRp gene showed that all the Korean BECs clustered together and were closely related to the NB-like viruses (80.9-88.1% nucleotide and 84.5-98.4% amino acid) but not to the NA1-like viruses (75.8-78.4% nucleotide and 79.7-82.8% amino acid). Although these viruses could not be classified into NA1-and NB-like viruses from the sequence and phylogenetic data of the entire capsid gene, all the Korean BECs clustered together on a branch separate from the other known BECs. These results show that these BEC infections are endemic in diarrheic calves in South Korea. The infecting strains are genetically closer to the NB-like viruses but have a distinct evolutionary pathway. #",
