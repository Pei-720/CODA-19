      "original_text": "Cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) are usually lymphopenic and have lymphoid depletion evident in spleen and lymph nodes. In particular, the number of CD4 þ lymphocytes in tissues decreases during the evolution of FIP lesions. This decrease is most likely due to increased lymphocyte apoptotic rate. In contrast, cats infected with the Feline Coronavirus (FCoV) develop a follicular hyperplasia in the peripheral lymph nodes. The current study was devised to evaluate the possible pathogenic role of shifts in circulating lymphocyte subsets in FIP. Peripheral blood from cats with FIP was evaluated and compared with peripheral blood from clinically healthy cats living in both FCoV-free and FCoV-endemic catteries. Blood from cats with diseases other than FIP was also examined in order to define the diagnostic relevance of the changes. Lymphocyte subsets were analysed by flow cytometry, using a whole blood indirect immunofluorescence technique and mAbs specific for feline CD5, CD4, CD8, CD21. The results of the current study suggest that cats recently infected with FCoV that do not develop the disease have a transient increase in T cells; cats from groups with high prevalence of FIP have a moderate but persistent decrease in T cell subsets; cats with FIP have a very severe decrease in all the subsets of lymphocytes. Moreover, during FIP many lymphocytes do not express any membrane antigen, most likely due to early apoptosis. Cats with diseases other than FIP also had decreased number of lymphocytes: as a consequence, the diagnostic relevance of these findings is very low. Nevertheless, the lack of flow cytometric changes had a high negative predictive value (NPV), thus allowing to exclude FIP from the list of possible diagnoses in cats with normal cytograms. #",
