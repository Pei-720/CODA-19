      "original_text": "Mammalian cells recognize virus-derived nucleic acids using a defined set of intracellular sensors including the DNA sensors cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) and interferon gamma (IFNγ)-inducible protein 16 (IFI16) as well as viral RNA receptors of the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptor (RLR) family. Following innate immune recognition, these sensors launch an immune response that is characterized by the transcriptional upregulation of many antiviral molecules, including proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and IFN-stimulated genes. Recent studies have demonstrated that the signal transduction initiated by these sensors is sophisticatedly regulated by post-translational modifications (PTMs) resulting in a robust yet \u0027tunable\u0027 cytokine response to maintain immune homeostasis. Here we summarize recent advances in our understanding of how PTMs and regulatory enzymes control the signaling activity of RLRs, cGAS, and IFI16 as well as their proximal adaptor proteins. [1, 5] . In vitro studies and studies in mice demonstrated that recognition of viral RNA PAMPs by RIG-I and MDA5 confers resistance to a wide spectrum of RNA viruses, including flaviviruses, influenza viruses, rhabdoviruses, paramyxoviruses, and picornaviruses. In addition, RLRs are involved in detecting DNA virus infections, a mechanism that, in the case of RIG-I, relies on the recognition of RNA polymerase IIIgenerated viral transcripts, at least for some DNA viruses (e.g., adenoviruses, Epstein-Barr virus).",

Following recognition of viral dsDNA -derived from either a DNA virus (e.g., herpesviruses) or retroviral infection -cytoplasmic cGAS catalyzes the formation of the second messenger cGAMP, which binds to and activates STING. The binding of cGAMP to STING results in the translocation of the adaptor protein from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi and perinuclear sites. Activated STING dimerizes and binds to TBK1, resulting in IRF3 activation and IFNα/β gene expression. The sensor IFI16 is reportedly localized in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus and detects viral dsDNA via its hematopoietic expression, IFN-inducible nature, and nuclear localization (HIN) domain followed by signaling to STING to initiate an IFN-mediated antiviral response. In addition to its ability to elicit type I IFN induction, IFI16 also leads to IL-1β secretion via activation of caspase 1dependent inflammasomes (reviewed in [4]).",
