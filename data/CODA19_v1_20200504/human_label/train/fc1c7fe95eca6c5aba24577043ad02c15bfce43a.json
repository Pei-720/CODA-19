      "original_text": "Objective: This study was conducted to identify the association between rs4804803 polymorphism in DC-SIGN with the susceptibility of severe dengue. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted to identify all eligible papers in PubMed, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Google Scholar. Odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were used to assess the association. Subgroup analyses were performed by ethnicity. Sensitivity analyses were performed through employing different statistical models (fixed versus random effect model). Results: A total of nine papers and 12 studies, with 1520 severe dengue and 1496 clinical dengue infection were included. The overall meta-analysis revealed significant associations between rs4804803 and severe dengue under the recession (GG versus GA/AA: OR \u003d 0.44, 95%CI, 0.23-0.82) and a codominant model (GG versus AA: OR \u003d 0.43, 95%CI, 0.23-0.81), but sensitivity analysis indicated that the significant pooled ORs were not robust. The subgroup analysis suggested that the carrier of G in rs4804803 was a risk factor for severe dengue under dominant (GG/GA versus AA: OR \u003d 1.86,95%CI, 1.01-3.45), superdominant (GA versus GG/AA: OR \u003d 1.81,95%CI, 1.02-3.21) and a codominant (GA versus AA: OR\u003d1.82,95%CI, 1.02-3.26) models in Asians, while it was a protective factor for severe dengue in South-central Americans under recessive (GG versus GA/AA: OR \u003d 0.27,95%CI, 0.10-0.70) and codominant (GG versus AA: OR\u003d0.24,95%CI, 0.09-0.64) models. The results from subgroup analysis were robust. Conclusions: Dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) promoter-336G/A (rs4804803) polymorphism is association with severe dengue, and it acts in different directions for Asians and South-central Americans.",
