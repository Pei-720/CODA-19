The isotype specificity of these tests relies on the specificity of the MCAs and was confirmed for each test by the observation that samples containing rotavirus antibodies of only 1 particular isotype reacted only in the homologous assay. The MCAs against bovine Ig isotypes and isotype-specific EL1SAs were found to be very useful in the study of humoral mucosal immunity in calves infected with rotavirus. * Where appropriate the word \u0027isotype\u0027 includes subclasses lgG 1 and lgG 2.",
