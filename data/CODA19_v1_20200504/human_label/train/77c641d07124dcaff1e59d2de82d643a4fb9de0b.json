A cross-validation model was applied to measure the accuracy of the Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classifiers. Experimental results demonstrate that SVM and Decision Tree classifiers achieved the highest accuracy of 86.44% for binary classification based on healthcare personnel class. On the other hand, for multiclass classification based on city class, the decision tree classifier had the highest accuracy among the remaining classifiers; although it did not reach a satisfactory accuracy level (42.80%). This work is intended to be a part of a MERS-CoV prediction system to enhance the diagnosis of MERS-CoV disease.",
