Because MERS has no pathognomonic signs distinguishing it from other respiratory infections, cohort B, including 85 samples from acute non-HCoV respiratory infections, was used to assess specificity in acute cases. To further evaluate specificity, cohort C included serum samples from acute to convalescent HCoV-NL63, ï€­229E, and -OC43 patients. Furthermore, we assessed Cohorts D-G were used to evaluate sensitivity of the different platforms. Serologically identified MERS-CoV-infected mild and asymptomatic persons with camel contact (D1) and healthy donors (D2) from Qatar characterized in an earlier study (1) constituted cohort D. Serial serum samples from 2 RT-PCRdiagnosed MERS-CoV case-patients imported to the Netherlands (2) were used as positive controls and to evaluate antibody kinetics; these were 15 serum samples from patient 1, ranging 4-228 days postdiagnosis (dpd), and 13 from patient 2, ranging 1-44 dpd. These 28 samples were categorized into cohorts E (\u003c14 dpd, acute phase) and F (\u003e14 dpd, convalescent phase).",
