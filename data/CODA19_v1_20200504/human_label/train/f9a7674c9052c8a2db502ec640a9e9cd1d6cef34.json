To decompose the time-series data, Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) was applied to properly describe the trends of HIV and AIDS incidence. A mathematical model was used to estimate the relative change of incidence among provinces and age groups. Results: A total of 483,010 newly HIV infections and 214,205 AIDS cases were reported between 2004 and 2014 nationwide. HIV infection increased from 13,258 in 2004 (RI 1.02 per 100,000 person years) to 74,048 in 2014 (RI 5.46 per 100,000). The number of AIDS cases increased from 3054 in 2004 (RI 0.23 per 100,000) to 45,145 in 2014 (RI 3.33",

The relative increase for HIV and AIDS RI was higher in northwest provinces while lower in Henan, Xinjiang, Guangxi and Yunnan. The overall relative changes for HIV infection were 1.12 (95% CI 1.11-1.14) in males and 1.10 (95% CI 1.06-1.13) in females. For AIDS RI, the relative increases were 1.31 (95% CI 1.26-1.36) in males and 1.22 (95% CI 1.17-1.28) in females. The lowest relative increase was detected among young adults, while the largest relative increase (odds ratio [OR] \u003e 1.30) was detected in people aged 55 years or above.
