The fatality rate in HRV-infected patients was high (83%), but all patients had significant coinfections, and the overall mortality rate was not different from that of patients who were negative for HRV in BAL samples. These results suggest that HRV may be a cause of lower respiratory tract infections in HSCT recipients and that its detection in BAL samples is associated with frequent copathogens. Whether the poor prognosis is due to HRV or the copathogen is not clear.",
