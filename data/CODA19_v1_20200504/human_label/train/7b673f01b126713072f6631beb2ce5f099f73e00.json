We monitored arterial pressure (AP) and heart rate (HR) in patients with EV71 infection and analyzed the variability of AP and HR. Sympathetic activity, AP, and HR increased with respiratory stress. Thereafter, parasympathetic activity increased with decreases in AP and HR. The lungs showed edema with inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression. Destruction of the medial, ventral, and caudal medulla may lead to sympathetic overactivation, causing blood to shift to the lungs. The pathogenesis of PE may also involve iNOS and nitric oxide.",

Most patients recover without complications. Some patients manifest signs such as headache, profuse sweating, lethargy, paraparesis, and weakness of the limbs. Several patients infected with EV71 have died of fulminant pulmonary edema (PE) soon after infection [1, 2] . The pathogenesis of PE is still unknown. Chang et al. [2] postulated that viral destruction of the CNS may be the cause of death. Central sympathetic activation resulting in systemic vasoconstriction and the shift of blood volume to the pulmonary region of the circulatory system, as demonstrated in earlier findings from our laboratory, was used to explain centrogenic PE [2, 3] . However, studies by Chang et al. [1, 2] did not provide pathological evidence of CNS lesions, nor did they assess autonomic activity. In the present study, we report CNS lesions in patients associated with PE due to enterovirus",
