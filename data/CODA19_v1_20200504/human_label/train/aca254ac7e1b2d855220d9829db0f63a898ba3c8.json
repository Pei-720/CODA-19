      "original_text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is one of the most important causative pathogens of swine diarrhea, which is widely prevalent throughout the world and is responsible for significant economic losses in the commercial pig industry, both domestic and abroad. The spike (S) protein in the PEDV capsid structure can carry the major B lymphocyte epitope, which induces production of neutralizing antibodies and provides immunoprotective effects. Moreover, the conserved region encoded by the S gene can be considered a target for establishing a new diagnostic method and is a new candidate for vaccine design. In this study, use of anchorin pgsA\u0027 allowed the fusion protein of S-DCpep to express on the surface of recombinant Lactobacillus plantarum (NC8-pSIP409-pgsA\u0027-S-DCpep) NC8 strain. Mice were immunized by lavage administration of the recombinant NC8-pSIP409-pgsA\u0027-S-DCpep, which was observed to induce DC activation and high production of sIgA and IgG antibodies in experimental animals, while also eliciting production of significantly more IgA + B220 + B cells. More importantly, secretion of cytokines IFN-γ, IL-4 and IL-17 in mice that were vaccinated with NC8-pSIP409-pgsA\u0027-S-DCpep was remarkably increased. The results of our study suggest that NC8-pSIP409-pgsA\u0027-S-DCpep potently triggers cellular and humoral immune responses. The obtained experimental results can provide a theoretical basis that lays the foundation for production of a novel oral vaccine against PED.",
