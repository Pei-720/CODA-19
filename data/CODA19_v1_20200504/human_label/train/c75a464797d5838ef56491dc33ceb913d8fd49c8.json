      "original_text": "A series of 4-[1-(substituted aryl/alkyl carbonyl)-benzoimidazol-2-yl]-benzene sulphonic acids (1-20) was synthesized and evaluated, in vitro, for their antimicrobial activity and the results indicated that compounds 4-[1-(4-Nitrobenzoyl)-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl]-benzenesulfonic acid (9) and 4-(1-octadec-9-enoyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-benzenesulfonic acid (18) were found to be the most active ones. QSAR investigations indicated that the multi-target QSAR model was effective in describing the antimicrobial activity over the one-target QSAR models. Further the mt-QSAR model indicated the importance of the topological parameter, Balaban index (J) followed by the electronic parameter, LUMO and topological parameter, valence second order molecular connectivity index ( 2 c v ) in describing the antimicrobial activity of synthesized compounds (1-20).",
