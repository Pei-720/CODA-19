A valid method for the rational use of predictions for herb-drug interaction is a biggest challenge in guideline development process. Methods: This article summarises the development process by reviewing key literature from CPG developers. It focuseson key methods and challenges specific to CPGs for integration by using text mining and bioinformatics to provide a powerful adjunct to CPG development. Results: The guideline development process identified, together with new approaches, incorporates evidence-based methodology and provides better decisions through analysis of uncertain herb-drug interaction.",
