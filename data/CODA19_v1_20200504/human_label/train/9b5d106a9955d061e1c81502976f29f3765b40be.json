Tukey honest significant difference post hoc test indicated that year 2 and year 4 students had better SPs compliance than year 3 students. Further analysis using a univariate general linear model identified an interaction effect of perceived influence of nursing staff and year of study (F 1,593 Â¼ 3.72; P \u003c .05). The 5 following predictors for SPs compliance were identified: knowledge of SPs, perceived barriers, adequacy of training, management support, and influence of nursing staff. Conclusion: Although the SPs compliance among NSs was high, the compliance varied by year of study and was affected by the nursing staff. Furthermore, SPs compliance among NSs can be enhanced by increasing SPs knowledge, providing more SPs training, promoting management support, reducing identified SPs barriers, and improving nursing staff compliance to SPs.",
