The host factors required for alphavirus entry remain poorly characterized 2 . Using a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9-based screen, we identified the cell adhesion molecule Mxra8 as an entry mediator for multiple emerging arthritogenic alphaviruses including chikungunya (CHIKV), Ross River, Mayaro, and O\u0027nyong nyong (ONNV) viruses. Gene editing of mouse Mxra8 or human MXRA8 resulted in reduced viral infection of cells, and reciprocally, ectopic expression resulted in increased infection.
