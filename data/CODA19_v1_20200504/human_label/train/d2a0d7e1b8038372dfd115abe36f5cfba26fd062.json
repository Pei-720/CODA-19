      "original_text": "The endolysosomal, non-selective cation channels, two-pore channels (TPCs) and mucolipins (TRPMLs), regulate intracellular membrane dynamics and autophagy. While partially compensatory for each other, isoform-specific intracellular distribution, cell-type expression patterns, and regulatory mechanisms suggest different channel isoforms confer distinct properties to the cell. Scope of review: Briefly, established TPC/TRPML functions and interaction partners (\u0027interactomes\u0027) are discussed. Novel TRPML3 interactors are shown, and a meta-analysis of experimentally obtained channel interactomes conducted. Accordingly, interactomes are compared and contrasted, and subsequently described in detail for TPC1, TPC2, TRPML1, and TRPML3. Major conclusions: TPC interactomes are well-defined, encompassing intracellular membrane organisation proteins. TRPML interactomes are varied, encompassing cardiac contractility-and chaperone-mediated autophagy proteins, alongside regulators of intercellular signalling. General significance: Comprising recently proposed targets to treat cancers, infections, metabolic disease and neurodegeneration, the advancement of TPC/TRPML understanding is of considerable importance. This review proposes novel directions elucidating TPC/TRPML relevance in health and disease.",
