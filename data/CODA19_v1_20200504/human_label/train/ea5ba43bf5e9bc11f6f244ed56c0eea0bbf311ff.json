Then, combined with flow-injection analysis, a new CL system for determination of chrysin and baicalein was proposed. The method was based on the oxidation of chrysin and baicalein by acidic KMnO 4 in the presence of formaldehyde to produce strong CL emission. The present paper suggested a new model to discover new CL analytical system: first, to theoretical predict the CL behavior, and the second, to suggest analytical system.",
