The results indicate that CCL3 participates in an effective host response to MHV infection by contributing to CD11c + CD11b + CD8a À DC maturation, activation, and migration to cervical lymph nodes (CLN). Diminished CD8a À DC activation correlated with reduced IFN-g expression by virus-specific T cells accompanied by increased IL-10 production suggesting that CCL3 contributes to an effective host response to viral infection by enhancing the T cell activation potential of DC.
