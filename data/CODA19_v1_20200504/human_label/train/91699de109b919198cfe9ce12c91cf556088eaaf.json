The viral genomes contain a small duplicated element (SD) derived from the genomic 5\u0027 end far downstream of its original context. This sequence is followed by a larger duplication which encompasses the region coding for the protein p80(LD), a molecular marker for cpBVDV. The SD element codes for the viral protease ~20. In the case of the viruses analyzed here the aminoterminus of p80 is generated by autoproteolytic removal of the preceding SD-encoded protease. For one of the cpBVDV isolates a specific fusion protein (~28) could be identified which is composed of p20 and part of ~10, another viral protein.",
