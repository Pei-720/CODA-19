      "original_text": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus depends on a chymotrypsin-like cysteine proteinase (3CL pro ) to process the translated polyproteins to functional viral proteins. This enzyme is a target for the design of potential anti-SARS drugs. A series of ketones and corresponding mono-and di-fluoro ketones having two or three aromatic rings were synthesized as possible reversible inhibitors of SARS 3CL pro . The design was based on previously established potent inhibition of the enzyme by oxa analogues (esters), which also act as substrates. Structure-activity relationships and modeling studies indicate that three aromatic rings, including a 5-bromopyridin-3-yl moiety, are key features for good inhibition of SARS 3CL pro . Compound 11d, 2-(5-bromopyridin-3-yl)-1-(5-(4-chlorophenyl)furan-2-yl)ethanone and its a-monofluorinated analogue 12d, gave the best reversible inhibition with IC 50 values of 13 lM and 28 lM, respectively. In contrast to inhibitors having two aromatic rings, a-fluorination of compounds with three rings unexpectedly decreased the inhibitory activity.",
