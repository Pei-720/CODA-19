      "original_text": "Cell fusion is a powerful tool for understanding the molecular mechanisms of epigenetic reprogramming. In hybrid cells of somatic cells and pluripotential stem cells, including embryonic stem (ES) and embryonic germ cells, somatic nuclei acquire pluripotential competence. ES and embryonic germ cells retain intrinsic trans activity to induce epigenetic reprogramming. For generating hybrid cells, we have used the technique of electrofusion. Electrofusion is a highly effective, reproducible, and biomedically safe in vitro system. For successful cell fusion, two sequential steps of electric pulse stimulation are required for the alignment (pearl chain formation) of two different types of cells between electrodes in response to alternating current stimulation and for the fusion of cytoplasmic membranes by direct current stimulation. Optimal conditions for electrofusion with a pulse generator are introduced for ES and somatic cell fusion. Topics in the field of stem cell research include the successful production of cloned animals via the epigenetic reprogramming of somatic cells and contribution of spontaneous cell fusion to generating intrinsic plasticity of tissue stem cells. Cell fusion technology may make important contributions to the fields of epigenetic reprogramming and regenerative medicine. derived from parental cells coordinately regulates the new phenotypes and functions of somatic hybrid cells.",

Cell fusion is also involved in the technique of animal cloning. The somatic donor nucleus is introduced into a recipient MII oocyte by cell fusion or direct injection. In the cloned embryos, the somatic type of cell phenotype and function is reprogrammed to the pluripotential type as a result of genomewide epigenetic modifications via the activity of trans-acting factors preserved in unfertilized oocytes.

Moreover, embryonic germ (EG) cells derived from gonadal primordial germ cells of mouse E11.5 and 12.5 embryos, in which the majority of parental imprints are erased (7), possess additional activity for inducing reprogramming of parental imprints on somatic genomes accompanied by DNA demethylation in the EG hybrid cells (8).
