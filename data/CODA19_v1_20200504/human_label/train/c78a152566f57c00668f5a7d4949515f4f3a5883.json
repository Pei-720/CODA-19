He reported he was usually in good health until the current symptoms began. Scott said that he had been unable to swallow solid foods over the past week, largely due to increasing pain on swallowing, and was now unable to swallow liquids as well. Although he stated that his appetite was unchanged, he estimated a fivepound weight loss over the last week due to poor oral intake. He otherwise denied fever, respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms, or any other complaints. He takes no medications at home except for rare acetaminophen. He is married, has a twoyear-old son, and works as an attorney. He denied use of tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Family history was noncontributory.",
