For Treg-immune-suppression-assays, purified CD4 + CD25 + Treg suspensions were incubated with CD4 + effector T cells in the presence of ConA and irradiated spleen cells as APCs.

Our study provides a comprehensive evidence for a major involvement of the recently identified CD4 + CD25 + Regulatory T Cell Effector Molecule FGL2 to the outcome of AE. Our major findings are as follows: 1) FGL2 is mostly secreted by Tregs and partly contributes to their functions; 2) FGL2 can downregulate the maturation of DCs, suppress Th1 and Th17 immune responses, and support Th2 and Treg immune responses, and finally 3) IL-17A contributes to FGL2 secretion. Based on the present findings in mice, we will investigate FGL2 as a potential marker of progression of AE in human patients, or as a potential immunotherapeutical target. Early prediction of parasite regression (currently not yet possible) would allow clinicians to plan for withdrawing benzimidazole treatment, which is currently administered for life. Then, FGL2 should be investigated as a target for an anticipated immunomodulatory treatment of patients with progressive AE, especially of those who are non-or low-responders to benzimidazole treatment, or who suffer from side-effects due to chemotherapy.
