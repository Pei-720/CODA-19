This coronavirus, like influenza virus, can replicate normally in the presence of cr-amanitin in Chinese hamster ovary cells which possess a drug-resistant RNA polymerase II. These findings indicate that avian infectious bronchitis virus requires the intact cell nucleus and one or more host transcriptional functions for productive infections, Preliminary data suggest that these cellular functions involve some aspect of virus-directed RNA synthesis.",
