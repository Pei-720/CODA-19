Animal studies suggest daptomycin may be useful for the treatment of endocarditis. Daptomycin is not indicated for pneunionia, with poorer outcomes than conventional treatnient. It is available as an IV niedication and exhibits 92% plasnia protein binding in vitro. In healthy adult humans, daptoniycin has a volume of distribution of 0.1 Ukg and a plasma elimination half-life of -9 hours, and is eliminated primarily by renal excretion (-54%). In patients with reduced renal function, including those receiving hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, the dose interval should be 48 hours. No dosage adjustnient appears to be necessary for mild to nioderate hepatic impairnient. The use of daptomycin in patients with severe hepatic irnpairnient has not been assessed. The niost comnionly reported adverse events include constipation, nausea, injection-site reactions, headache, and diarrhea. Patients should also be nionitored regularly for skeletal niuscle toxicity.",
