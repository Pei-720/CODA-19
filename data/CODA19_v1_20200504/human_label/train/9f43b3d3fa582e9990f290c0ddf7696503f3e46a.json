      "original_text": "Objectives: The rapid emergence of drug-resistant Shigella sonnei is a serious public health problem. This study aimed to characterise the antimicrobial resistance patterns, molecular subtypes, and integron types and resistance gene cassettes in S. sonnei from Jiangsu Province, China. Methods: In total, 340 S. sonnei were collected in 2002-2011 throughout Jiangsu Province. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), PCR amplification of integrons, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and DNA sequencing of cassette regions were performed. Results: Resistance rates to ampicillin (67.7%), nalidixic acid (75.2%), tetracycline (73.7%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (68.7%) remained high. Strains from Centre and South Jiangsu showed higher resistance and multiresistance rates compared with the North. PFGE analysis indicated that largescale clonal transmission among different cities occurred several times during 10 years. Among all strains, 55.9% (190/340) harboured class 1 integrons, 80.3% (273/340) harboured class 2 integrons and 49.4% (168/340) harboured an atypical class 1 integron. Resistance rates to nine antimicrobials in the class 1 integron-positive group were significantly higher than in the negative group (P \u003c 0.05). Seven different gene cassettes were detected in class 1 integrons. The most prevalent type was aacA4-cmlA1 (114/286). Class 2 integrons carried the gene cassette array dfrA1-sat1-aadA1, and the atypical class 1 integron carried bla OXA-30 -aadA1. Conclusions: The increasing antimicrobial resistance and significant clonal transmission of S. sonnei circulating in Jiangsu were closely related to the high prevalence of integrons and gene cassettes. Longterm cross-regional monitoring of antimicrobial resistance is urgently required for S. sonnei.",
