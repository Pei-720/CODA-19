It is possible that people having the kind of work conditions we suspect can increase the risk of contagion ALSO have a higher risk for contagion outside of work (for example having kids at nursery). But if we gain knowledge of that risk we can \"sort it out\". Then we are able to more accurately estimate the risk of being infected at work.
