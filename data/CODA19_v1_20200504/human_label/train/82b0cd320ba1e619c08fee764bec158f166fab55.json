However, at this time, there is no drug approved to treat ZIKV infection. Drug repurposing is the promptest way to obtain an effective drug during a global public health emergency such as the spread of Zika virus. In this study, we report a US Food and Drug Admistration-approved drug that is safe for pediatric use. Nitazoxanide and its bioactive metabolite, tizoxanide, have anti-ZIKV potential in vitro, and we identified that they exerts antiviral effect possibly by targeting the viral postattachment step.",
