In the event of an influenza pandemic, optometrists may be challenged with a host of issues, including impediments to clinical patient care, manufacture and delivery of ophthalmic devices, and maintaining business continuity and infection control. OVERVIEW: This report reviews pandemic influenza, the effect of a pandemic event on business survival, and response measures for the primary eye care provider. The ethical and legal issues surrounding control of a pandemic influenza and the prospect of telemedicine as a form of social distancing are also discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of the pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic measures to control a pandemic influenza will help prepare the eye care provider for addressing challenges to patient care and business continuity in the face of a highly contagious disease. Understanding the legal and ethical issues that arise during a pandemic event will help optometrists make informed choices as health care professionals and as citizens. Optometry 2007;78:629-643",
