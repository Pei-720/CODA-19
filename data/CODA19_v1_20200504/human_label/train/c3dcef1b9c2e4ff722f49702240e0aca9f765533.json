Temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate were 98.6°F, 250 beats/min, and 42 breaths/min, respectively. Abdominal palpation revealed an enlarged spleen and pain on caudal abdominal manipulation. No other abnormalities were detected on physical examination. Based on the history and physical examination findings, the ferret was admitted for additional diagnostic testing and therapy.",
