All phosphonates were assessed for antiviral activity against a broad range of DNA and RNA viruses and several of them showed potency against varicella-zoster virus (VZV) [EC 50 (50% effective concentration) \u003d 27.6-91.5 µM]. Compound 16b exhibited the highest activity against a thymidine kinase-deficient (TK − ) VZV strain (EC 50 \u003d 27.59 µM), while 16d was the most potent towards TK + VZV (EC 50 \u003d 29.91 µM). Cytostatic properties of the compounds 14a-i-17a-i were studied on L1210, CEM, HeLa and HMEC-1 cell lines and most of them were slightly cytostatic for HeLa [IC 50 (50% inhibitory concentration) \u003d 29-130 µM] and L1210 cells [IC 50 (50% inhibitory concentration) \u003d 14-142 µM].",
