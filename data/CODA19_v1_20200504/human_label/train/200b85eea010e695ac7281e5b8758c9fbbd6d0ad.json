      "original_text": "were denied by insurance. Of 41 patients initially screened, 10% lacked an available haploidentical donor, 29% had elevated donor-specific antibodies (DSAs), and 34% declined to proceed to HSCT. All 10 patients who were transplanted received peripheral blood stem cells. The initial 2 were conditioned with alemtuzumab/total body irradiation (TBI) 3 Gy followed by post-transplant cyclophosphamide and failed to engraft. The next 8 patients received the regimen developed at Johns Hopkins University with TBI 3 Gy. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was administered from day +12 in those with HbS \u003c 30%. All 8 patients engrafted with a median time to neutrophil \u003e.5 × 10 9 /L of 22 days (range, 18 to 23). One patient subsequently lost the graft, and 7 (87.5%) maintained \u003e95% donor cell chimerism at 1-year post-HSCT. Two patients developed acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of at least grade II. One had chronic GVHD and died \u003e1 year after HSCT of unknown causes. With a median follow-up of 16 months (range, 11 to 29), 7 patients (87.5%) are alive. Our findings suggest that limited insurance coverage, high rate of DSAs, and patient declining HSCT may limit the availability of haploidentical HSCT in adult SCD patients. The modified Hopkins regimen used here demonstrates high engraftment and low morbidity rates and should be tested in larger, multicenter, prospective clinical trials.",
