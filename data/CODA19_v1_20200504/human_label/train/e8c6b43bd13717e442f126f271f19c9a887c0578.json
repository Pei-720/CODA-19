      "original_text": "Renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a major cause of acute kidney injury (AKI), which could induce the poor prognosis. The purpose of this study was to characterize the molecular mechanism of the functional changes of CD11b + /Ly6C intermediate macrophages after renal IRI. The gene expression profiles of CD11b + /Ly6C intermediate macrophages of the sham surgery mice, and the mice 4 h, 24 h and 9 days after renal IRI were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Analysis of mRNA expression profiles was conducted to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), biological processes and pathways by the series test of cluster. Protein-protein interaction network was constructed and analysed to discover the key genes. A total of 6738 DEGs were identified and assigned to 20 model profiles. DEGs in profile 13 were one of the predominant expression profiles, which are involved in immune cell chemotaxis and proliferation. Signet analysis showed that Atp5a1, Atp5o, Cox4i, Cdc42, Rac2 and Nhp2 were the key genes involved in oxidation-reduction, apoptosis, migration, M1-M2 differentiation, and proliferation of macrophages. RPS18 may be an appreciate reference gene as it was stable in macrophages. The identified DEGs and their enriched pathways investigate factors that may participate in the functional changes of CD11b + /Ly6C intermediate macrophages after renal IRI. Moreover, the vital gene Nhp2 may involve the polarization of macrophages, which may be a new target to affect the process of AKI.",
