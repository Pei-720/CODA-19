The pathogenic mechanism of dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) is complicated and is not clearly understood. The hallmarks of the dengue disease, the antibody-dependent enhancement, the shift from T-helper type 1 (Th1) to Th2 cytokine response and the cytokine tsunami resulting in vascular leakage can now be explained much better with the knowledge gained about NO and peroxynitrite. This paper makes an effort to present a synthesis of the current opinions to explain the pathogenesis of DHF/shock syndrome with NO on centre stage.",
