      "original_text": "Aim. To investigate whether vitamin C is effective in the treatment of the common cold. Method. After systematically searching the National Library of Medicine (PubMed), Cochrane Library, Elsevier, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP databases, and WANFANG databases, 9 randomized placebo-controlled trials were included in our meta-analysis in RevMan 5.3 software, all of which were in English. Results. In the evaluation of vitamin C, administration of extra therapeutic doses at the onset of cold despite routine supplementation was found to help reduce its duration (mean difference (MD) \u003d -0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) [-1.03, -0.10], and P \u003d 0.02), shorten the time of confinement indoors (MD \u003d -0.41, 95% CI [-0.62, -0.19], and P \u003d 0.0002), and relieve the symptoms associated with it, including chest pain (MD \u003d -0.40, 95% CI [-0.77, -0.03], and P \u003d 0.03), fever (MD \u003d -0.45, 95% CI [-0.78, -0.11], and P \u003d 0.009), and chills (MD \u003d -0.36, 95% CI [-0.65, -0.07], and P \u003d 0.01). Conclusions. Extra doses of vitamin C could benefit some patients who contract the common cold despite taking daily vitamin C supplements.",
