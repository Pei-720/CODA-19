      "original_text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a small, enveloped RNA virus that is often capable of establishing a persistent infection, which may lead to chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and eventually death. For more than 20 years, hepatitis C patients have been treated with interferon-alpha (IFN-α). Current treatment usually consists of polyethylene glycol-conjugated IFN-α that is combined with ribavirin, but even the most advanced IFN-based therapies are still ineffective in eliminating the virus from a large proportion of individuals. Therefore, a better understanding of the IFN-induced innate immune response is urgently needed. By using selectable self-replicating RNAs (replicons) and, more recently, recombinant full-length genomes, many groups have tried to elucidate the mechanism(s) by which IFNs inhibit HCV replication. This chapter attempts to summarize the current state of knowledge in this interesting field of HCV research.",
