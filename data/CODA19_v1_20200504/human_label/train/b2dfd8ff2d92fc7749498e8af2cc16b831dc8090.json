      "original_text": "Genotype G9 is an emerging genotype among species A rotavirus (RVA) circulating in humans and pigs worldwide. In this study, an RVA strain designated RVA/Dog-tc/CHN/SCCD-A/2017/G9P[23] was isolated in cell culture from a pet dog stool sample with acute diarrhea, and its whole genome was sequenced. The genotype constellation of SCCD-A was G9-P[23]-I5-R1-C1-M1-A8-N1-T1-E1-H1. All genome segments except the VP1 gene were closely related to the genes from porcine RVA strains or porcine-like human RVA strains. On the other hand, the VP1 gene clustered in a distinct lineage only with that of a G5P[6] porcine-like human RVA, preventing the identification of the exact host species origin, but very unlikely to be originated from human RVA. In addition, phylogenetic analysis showed that the G9 VP7 gene of SCCD-A clustered into a novel sublineage within the lineage III of G9. This first isolation of a G9P[23] RVA from a pet dog may justify the exploration of the role dogs play in the interaction of RVA circulating in pigs and humans.",
