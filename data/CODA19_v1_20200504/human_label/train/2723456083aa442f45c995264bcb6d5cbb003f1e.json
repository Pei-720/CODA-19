(A) pDCs or mDCs were exposed to CSFV C-strain, Brescia strain, or a mock virus-infected cryolysate supernatant, and after 24 h in culture, the levels of TNF-␣ and type I IFN in the supernatants were analyzed using a porcine cytokine multiplex ELISA and Mx/CAT reporter gene assay, respectively. (B) Enriched NK and ␥␦ T cells were then cultured in cRPMI medium alone or in the presence of porcine recombinant IFN-␣ and/or TNF-␣, at concentrations comparable to those detected in infected pDC cocultures, and the expression of MHC-II was assessed by flow cytometry after 24 h. The mean Ϯ SEM data from three independent experiments utilizing different animals are shown. The values for each group were compared to the corresponding unstimulated control (mock stimulation in panel A and no cytokine treatment in panel B) using a one-way ANOVA, followed by Dunnett\u0027s multiple comparison test: ***, P Ͻ 0.001; **, P Ͻ 0.01; *, P Ͻ 0.05.
