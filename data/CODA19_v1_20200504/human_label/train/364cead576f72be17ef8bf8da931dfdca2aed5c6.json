Functional enrichment analysis suggested that FOS and DUSP1 were implicated in response to endogenous stimulus. In the PPI network analysis, FOS (degree\u003d20), EGR1 (degree\u003d16), ATF3 (degree\u003d9), NOS1 (degree\u003d8), CCL5 (degree\u003d8), DUSP1 (degree\u003d7), CXCL3 (degree\u003d6), VIP (degree\u003d6), FOSB (degree\u003d5), and NOS2 (degree\u003d4) had higher degrees, which could interact with other genes. In addition, two significant modules (module 1 and module 2) were identifi ed from the PPI network. Conclusion: Several genes (including FOS, EGR1, ATF3, NOS1, CCL5, DUSP1, CXCL3, VIP, FOSB, and NOS2) might be involved in the development of HSCR through their effect on the nervous system.
