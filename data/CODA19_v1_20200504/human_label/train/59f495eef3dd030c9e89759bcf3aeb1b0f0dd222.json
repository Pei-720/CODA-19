      "original_text": "Purpose: The aim of the study was to identify characteristic clinical features and outcomes of critically ill patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Materials and Methods: This retrospective study enrolled all patients admitted to a 12-bed SARS intensive care unit (ICU) in a tertiary care medical center in Taipei between May 15 and July 17, 2003. Patients with positive results of either reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction or antibody to SARS coronavirus were defined as SARS cases and others with negative results as control cases. Results: Of the 50 patients, 14 had confirmed SARS. Demographics were similar between the 2 groups. The highest leukocyte and neutrophil counts, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase; positive endexpiratory pressure; and use of corticosteroids, ribavirin, and intravenous immunoglobulin were higher in the SARS group. In contrast, the lowest lymphocyte count and the ratio of PaO 2 to the fraction of inspired oxygen were lower in the SARS group. Of the 15 deaths in the control group, 12 (80%) occurred during the first 2 weeks after ICU admission. However, in the confirmed SARS group, 5 (55.6%) of the 9 deaths occurred within the third or fourth week. This difference in timing between these 2 groups was significant (P \u003d .004). Conclusions: In a SARS ICU, patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS had significantly different clinical features and timing of mortality from those of the control group.",
