We show that, in equilibrium, whether the public firm engages in innovation more aggressively than the private firm depends on the degree of spillovers. Moreover, firms\u0027 equilibrium locations exhibit neither maximal nor minimal differentiation. Finally, privatization could reduce social welfare because it may generate inefficient location and insufficient R\u0026D investment. This suggests that a mixed duopoly could be socially preferable to a private duopoly in the presence of endogenous R\u0026D spillovers.",
