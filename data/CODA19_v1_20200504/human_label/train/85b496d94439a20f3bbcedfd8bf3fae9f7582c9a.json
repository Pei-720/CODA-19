      "original_text": "Background and purpose: To describe the use of debates, and to evaluate student performance and perceptions, when student debates are incorporated as an active learning tool in a required pharmacy healthcare delivery course. Educational activity and setting: Student live debates replaced 15% of a traditional lecture-based course. Twelve healthcare controversies were debated by student teams each year. Student perception of debate utility and opinion on topics, pre-and post-debate, were measured via a voluntary survey. Both peer and instructor\u0027s assessments of team performances, as well as individual student performance on the debate-based questions on course exams, contributed to course grade. Findings: The average survey response rates were 76% (2014) and 86% (2015). Fifteen-54% of student respondents changed their opinion on individual debate topics due to the debates. Although exam performance on debate-based questions was no better than on lecture-based questions, respondents who found the debates useful or very useful in mastering course material increased by 19% post versus pre-debate surveys. Summary: Debates are an effective active learning tool for engaging students in controversial subjects. Assessment of student performance should include student and instructor evaluations, and can be incorporated into the course grade.",
