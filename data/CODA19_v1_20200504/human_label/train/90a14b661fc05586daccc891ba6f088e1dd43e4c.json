      "original_text": "We carried out a study, using a questionnaire, that indicated that persons with Parkinson\u0027s disease (PD) catch relatively fewer colds that are unusually mild. This tendency seems to have no clear relationship to the severity of the PD, the time after the onset of PD, or whether or not the patient is taking antiparkinsonian drugs either as mono therapy or in combination. The study found no similar phenomena among spouses of the PD patients or among patients with cerebrovascular disease. These results suggest that a low frequency of colds is a unique feature in persons with PD. á­§",
