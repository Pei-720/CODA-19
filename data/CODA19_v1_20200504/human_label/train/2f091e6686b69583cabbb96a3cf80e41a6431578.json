      "original_text": "A novel virulent bacteriophage, vB_BbrM_PHB04, infecting Bordetella bronchiseptica was isolated from wastewater collected at a swine farm in China. Phage vB_BbrM_PHB04 exhibited growth over a wide range of temperature and pH conditions and showed different efficiency of plating values and lytic spectra within the same strains at 25 째C and 37 째C. Highthroughput sequencing revealed that vB_BbrM_PHB04 has a linear double-stranded DNA genome with 124 putative open reading frames. Overall, the genome of vB_BbrM_PHB04 showed very low similarity (the highest nucleotide identity 82%, 1% coverage) to other phage sequences in the GenBank database. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that vB_BbrM_PHB04 is a new member of the family Myoviridae. In addition, polymerase chain reaction-based detection of phage genes in phageresistant B. bronchiseptica variants revealed no evidence of lysogenic activity of phage vB_BbrM_PHB04.",
