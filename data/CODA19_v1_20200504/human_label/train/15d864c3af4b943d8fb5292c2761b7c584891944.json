      "original_text": "The unprecedented globalization of trade, travel, climate change, protectionism, and geopolitical populism, as well as pandemic health threats are no longer issues for a single nation. In the field of public health, China\u0027s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) offers immense opportunities for partnership and collective actions involving multiple countries to combat globalization-linked infectious and/or chronic diseases, emerging pandemics, and outbreaks of potential threats to both laboratory information management systems and health information management. The national and global health challenges have increasingly proved that economic prosperity cannot be achieved when huge knowledge and capacity gaps exist in health systems. There is thus a need for public health initiatives aimed at strengthening the health systems beyond sovereign borders to influence global geo-economics. We highlight situational insights that offer approaches and strategies for increasing public health investment and capacity development in the countries along the Belt and Road, enhancing public and global health cooperation alongside participation in disease control and elimination, promoting public health governance and data sharing for pandemic threats, and building shared values and benefits in public health through Sino-African cooperation and the BRI. Our approach also examines the values of the China\u0027s BRI in relation to public health, projections and initiatives for increasing new investment and development capacity in public health systems, and enhanced public and global health cooperation and participation toward the BRI\u0027s framework and scope.",
