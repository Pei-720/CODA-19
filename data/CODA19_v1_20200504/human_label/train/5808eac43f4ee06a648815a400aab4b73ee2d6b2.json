The nucleotide and amino acid sequences from the isolated field strains were compared to 42 published references. Nucleotide homologies ranged from 63.1-99.9% and amino acid homologies ranging from 60.2-100%. At least seven IBV genotypes were co-circulating in commercial chicken farms in southern China. The IBV isolates were genetically diverse and underwent continuing evolution. The QX-type, TW I-type, and 4/91-type were the most common genotypes during the three-year observation period and accounted for 88.8% of the isolated strains. Notably, the prevalence of the TW I-type strains has been increasing in recent years and has become the most common genotype in China. The emergence of variant IBV strains can be attributed to recombination. Serologic analysis and antigenic 3D cartography of 4 reference and 14 field isolated strains indicated the surveyed IBVs had diverse serology types and that the serotype of the isolated QX-type and TW I-type strains was distinct from the vaccines strains. Therefore, long-term continuing surveillance is necessary for IBV prevention and control.",

IB causes substantial economic losses throughout the poultry industry worldwide. IBV affects chickens of all ages causing upper respiratory disease, nephritic syndromes, and decreased egg production 1 . IBV has been circulating in China since 1982. The epidemiology of IBV in China is complicated due to the large geographical area, and multiple IBV genotypes and serotypes are known to coexist 2 . Our previous epidemiology monitoring during 2004 to 2012, found at least seven genotypes of IBV circulating. In that study, the QX-like IBV genotype that causes nephritis had become predominant in China 3-6 . Although IBV vaccines are widely used and most commercial chickens have been vaccinated, there are still frequent outbreaks of IB that cause clinical disease and production problems 7-9 . For example, widespread use of vaccines derived from Massachusetts (Mass) serotypes such as H120 and H52 did not prevent frequent outbreaks of IB in chicken flocks 10, 11 . IBV belongs to the genus Gammacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae, and order Nidovirales. Its genome is linear, non-segmented, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA that is approximately 27.6 kilobases (kb) in length. As with other coronaviruses, the IBV S1 glycoprotein contains virus neutralizing epitopes and serotype-specific sequences 12, 13 . The S1 protein is involved in infectivity and plays an important role in attachment to the host cell, as well as induction of neutralizing antibodies 14 . Given the importance of the S1 protein virus/host interactions, IBV genetic analysis and research of IBV has been primarily based on the S1 gene 15 .",
