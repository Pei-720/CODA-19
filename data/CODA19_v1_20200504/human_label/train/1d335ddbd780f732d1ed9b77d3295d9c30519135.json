Methods One hundred nine pediatric patients having respiratory tract infections were included in this study. Real time PCR, DFA and cell culture method were used for detection of C. pneumoniae, RSV antigen and influenza virus respectively. Multiplex PCR was used for detection of other viruses.",

Sensitivity of the PCR and DFA methods for the diagnosis of RSV infections were detected as 100 % and 100 %, respectively. Specificity of the PCR and DFA methods for RSV infections were detected as 97 % and 100 % respectively. Sensitivity of the PCR and cell culture methods for influenzavirus infections were detected as 100 % and 100 %, respectively.

Influenza viruses and RSV were common. Metapneumovirus was also frequent (3.6 %). C. pneumoniae was not found to be a common agent for acute respiratory disease in children.",
