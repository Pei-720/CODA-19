Objective: This study was conducted to analyzed in detail the dynamic changes and functional properties of circulating follicular CXCR5 + CD8 + T cells to explore their effects on DENV2 infection. Methods: Circulating follicular CXCR5 + CD8 + T cells and cytokines were analyzed by flow cytometry in DENV2 patients at difference days after DENV2 infection. CD8 + T cells were isolated and purified from DENV2 patients, then were stimulated with NS1 peptides and TCR stimulant. After cultivation, multiple parameters were tested. Results: (1) CXCR5 + CD8 + T cells emerged after DENV2 infection, with high PD-1 expression, and were correlated with the reduction in DENV2 RNA viral loads. (2) PD-1 + CXCR5 + CD8 + T cells were negatively associated with disease progression. (3) Serum IFN-g, IL-6 and IL-10 levels were increased late in the course of DENV2 infection. (4) CXCR5 + CD8 + T cells from DENV2 patients exhibited increased cytotoxicity and IFN-g and IL-10 secretion. Conclusion: CXCR5 + CD8 + T cells could play a protective role in dengue pathogenesis and may be a novel strategy for controlling DENV2 infection and vaccine development.",
