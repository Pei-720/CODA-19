Study design Eligible infants aged #4 months presenting to the main pediatric emergency service with apnea associated bronchiolitis were stratified by gestational age (\u003c34 weeks or longer) and randomized to receive a single dose of intravenous 25 mg/kg caffeine citrate or saline placebo. The primary efficacy outcome was a 24-hour apnea-free period beginning after completion of the blinded study drug infusion. Secondary outcomes were frequency of apnea by 24, 48, and 72 hours after study medication, need for noninvasive/invasive ventilation, and length of stay in the hospital\u0027s pediatric intensive care/step-down unit.",
