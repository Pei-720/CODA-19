      "original_text": "Background: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) caused multiple outbreaks. Such outbreaks increase economic and infection control burdens. We studied the infection control influence of MERS-CoV using a hospital-based analysis. Methods: Our hospital had 17 positive and 82 negative cases of MERS-CoV between April 1, 2013, and June 3, 2013. The study evaluated the impact of these cases on the use of gloves, surgical masks, N95 respirators, alcohol-based hand sanitizer, and soap, as well as hand hygiene compliance rates. Results: During the study, the use of personal protective equipment during MERS-CoV compared with the period before MERS-CoV increased dramatically from 2,947.4 to 10,283.9 per 1,000 patient-days (P \u003c .0000001) for surgical masks and from 22 to 232 per 1,000 patient-days (P \u003c .0000001) for N95 masks. The use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer and soap showed a significant increase in utilized amount (P \u003c .0000001). Hand hygiene compliance rates increased from 73% just before the occurrence of the first MERS case to 88% during MERS cases (P \u003d .0001). The monthly added cost was $16,400 for included infection control items. Conclusions: There was a significant increase in the utilization of surgical masks, respirators, soap and alcohol-based hand sanitizers. Such an increase is a challenge and adds cost to the healthcare system.",
