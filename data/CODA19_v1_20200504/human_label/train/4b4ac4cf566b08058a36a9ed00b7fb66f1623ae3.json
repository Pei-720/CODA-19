      "original_text": "Since its first report in the Middle East in 2012, the Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has become a global concern due to the high morbidity and mortality of individuals infected with the virus. Although the majority of MERS-CoV cases have been reported in Saudi Arabia, the overall risk in areas outside the Middle East remains significant as inside Saudi Arabia. Additional pandemics of MERS-CoV are expected, and thus novel tools and reagents for therapy and diagnosis are urgently needed. Here, we used phage display to develop novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target MERS-CoV. A human Fab phage display library was panned against the S2 subunit of the MERS-CoV spike protein (MERS-S2P), yielding three unique Fabs (S2A3, S2A6, and S2D5). The Fabs had moderate apparent affinities (Half maximal effective concentration (EC 50 \u003d 123-421 nM) for MERS-S2P, showed no cross-reactivity to spike proteins from other CoVs, and were non-aggregating and thermostable (T m \u003d 61.5-80.4 • C). Reformatting the Fabs into IgGs (Immunoglobulin Gs) greatly increased their apparent affinities (K D \u003d 0.17-1.2 nM), presumably due to the effects of avidity. These apparent affinities were notably higher than that of a previously reported anti-MERS-CoV S2 reference mAb (K D \u003d 8.7 nM). Furthermore, two of the three mAbs (S2A3 and S2D5) bound only MERS-CoV (Erasmus Medical Center (EMC)) and not other CoVs, reflecting their high binding specificity. However, the mAbs lacked MERS-CoV neutralizing activity. Given their high affinity, specificity, and desirable stabilities, we anticipate that these anti-MERS-CoV mAbs would be suitable reagents for developing antibody-based diagnostics in laboratory or hospital settings for point-of-care testing. Antibodies 2019, 8, 42 2 of 16 was initiated in South Korea in 2015 and outbreaks still sporadically occur in various regions, including the Middle East [1,2]",

Upon entry of the virus into cells, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit recognizes the host cell receptors dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) or CD26 [10-12], while the S2 subunit has a role in viral fusion with host cell membranes through the interplay of two heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2) and a transmembrane domain on the S2 subunit [6, 13] .",

Due to its critical role in the interaction with host cell receptors, tremendous efforts have been focused on the discovery of neutralizing mAbs against the RBD of the MERS-CoV S1 subunit [15] [16] [17] [18] . Strategies have included phage or yeast display library selection; immunization of animals, such as humanized mice and dromedary camels; and antibody isolation from human survivors of MERS-CoV infection. However, a drawback of the mAbs is their costly and time-consuming production in mammalian cell lines.

However, such mutations are less common in the S2 subunit, which makes it an attractive target for therapeutic purposes.
