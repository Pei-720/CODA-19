Working with highly infectious viral agents requires a team of trained scientists, laboratory technicians, veterinarians, animal care staff, biological safety officers, engineers, and physical plant staff to ensure safety, biocontainment, and the animals\u0027 well being, while providing essential scientific data. The challenges of working with infectious disease agents in high levels of containment, and some solutions to these challenges, are described from an animal care point of view.",
