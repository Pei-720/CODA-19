      "original_text": "East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) from the ␤-CoV subgroup, require the proteolytic activity of the nsp5 protease (also known as 3C-like protease, 3CL pro ) during virus replication, making it a high value target for the development of anti-coronavirus therapeutics. Kinetic studies indicate that in contrast to 3CL pro from other ␤-CoV 2c members, including HKU4 and HKU5, MERS-CoV 3CL pro is less efficient at processing a peptide substrate due to MERS-CoV 3CL pro being a weakly associated dimer. Conversely, HKU4, HKU5, and SARS-CoV 3CL pro enzymes are tightly associated dimers. Analytical ultracentrifugation studies support that MERS-CoV 3CL pro is a weakly associated dimer (K d ϳ52 M) with a slow off-rate. Peptidomimetic inhibitors of MERS-CoV 3CL pro were synthesized and utilized in analytical ultracentrifugation experiments and demonstrate that MERS-CoV 3CL pro undergoes significant ligand-induced dimerization. Kinetic studies also revealed that designed reversible inhibitors act as activators at a low compound concentration as a result of induced dimerization. Primary sequence comparisons and x-ray structural analyses of two MERS-CoV 3CLpro and inhibitor complexes, determined to 1.6 Å , reveal remarkable structural similarity of the dimer interface with 3CL pro from HKU4-CoV and HKU5-CoV. Despite this structural similarity, substantial differences in the dimerization ability suggest that long range interactions by the nonconserved amino acids distant from the dimer interface may control MERS-CoV 3CL pro dimerization. Activation of MERS-CoV 3CL pro through ligand-induced dimerization appears to be unique within the genogroup 2c and may potentially increase the complexity in the development of MERS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitors as antiviral agents.",
