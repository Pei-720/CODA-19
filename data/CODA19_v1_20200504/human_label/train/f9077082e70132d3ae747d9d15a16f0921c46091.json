This is primarily due to limitations of diagnostic testing modalities: blood cultures, antigen testing and antibody titers, and the need for invasive means to retrieve specimens. 1,4 Two studies illustrate our limited ability to diagnose the etiology of pneumonia in children. In a prospective study of 168 ambulatory children with CAP, an etiologic agent was identifi ed in only 43% of cases. 5 These included Streptococcus pneumoniae (27%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (7%) and Chlamydia pneumoniae (6%). Patients with S. pneumoniae frequently had a mixed infection (40%). Of 157 patients tested for viral infection, 20% were positive by culture and/or direct fl uorescent antibody test. Viral etiologies identifi ed included respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), infl uenza viruses A and B, parainfl uenza viruses 1 and 3, adenovirus, enterovirus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus. All viral isolates were identifi ed in children less than 8 years of age. 5 A similar study, in 254 hospitalized children with CAP, identifi ed a potential causative agent in 85% of cases. 6 Extensive diagnostic testing accounted for the relatively high yield in this study. Similar etiologies identifi ed, in decreasing frequency of occurrence, included S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus infl uenzae, M. pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, C. pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Chlamydia trachomatis. Viral etiologies included (most common to least common) RSV, rhinovirus, parainfl uenza viruses 1 through 3, adenovirus, infl uenza virus A and B, coronavirus, human herpesvirus 6, Epstein-Barr virus, and varicella-zoster virus. Mixed viralbacterial infections were detected in 30% of patients, and 41% of patients had more than one microbiologic agent identifi ed. Of interest, of 93 patients with S. pneumoniae, only one had a positive blood culture. The remaining 92 patients were diagnosed based solely on serologic evidence. 6 A prospective analysis seeking to identify etiologic agents via a pneumolysin-based polymerase chain reaction assay identifi ed a respiratory pathogen in 79% of 154 pediatric patients with lower respiratory tract infection. The most common etiologic agent was S. pneumoniae (44%). Of 68 patients with S. pneumoniae infection, 18% had a coinfection with another bacteria and 31% had a co-infection with a virus. Atypical agents (M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae) accounted for 22% of all infections (14% and 9%, respectively). The most common viral etiologies included",
