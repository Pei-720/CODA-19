      "original_text": "Background: The detrimental role of viruses has been well described in CF, although the pattern of virus infections has not been investigated in a longitudinal study. The primary aim was to determine the feasibility of fortnightly parent collected swabs in young children with CF. Methods: Children under three years with CF were recruited. Nasal swabs were collected by parents every fortnight and during periods of symptoms over 12 months. Nasal swabs were posted and virus detected using real-time PCR. Results: Only 27% of the patients completed the study to 10 months, although 98% of the swabs returned were adequate for analysis. Mould was observed growing on 23% of the returned swabs. There was no evidence to demonstrate relationships with symptoms and viruses, prolonged symptoms, prolonged shedding or patterns of virus infections. Conclusions: This study highlights the need to further investigate the role of viruses in children with CF using a robust method of frequent collection in children for a longitudinal study, with appropriate storage and shipping techniques to avoid mould growth or other potential contaminants.",
