For example , C57BL/6 (B6) mice infected with mouse hepatitis virus (JHM strain , JHMV) develop severe encephalitis , with death occurring within 7 days. Here, we show that the host response to a single JHMVspecific immunodominant CD4 T-cell epitope is critical for severe disease. We engineered a recombinant JHMV with mutations in the immunodominant CD4 T-cell epitope (rJ.M Y135Q ). Infection of naïve B6 mice with this virus resulted in mild disease with no mortality. However , introduction of a CD4 T-cell epitope from Listeria monocytogenes into rJ.M Y135Q generated a highly virulent virus. The decrease in disease severity was not due to a switch from Th1 to Th2 predominance in rJ.M Y135Q -infected mice , an effect on CD8 T-cell function , or differential expression of tumor necrosis factor-␣ by JHMV-specific CD4 T cells. These results show that the response to a single virus-specific CD4 T-cell epitope may contribute to a pathogenic host response in the setting of acute viral disease and that abrogation of this response ameliorates clinical disease without diminishing virus clearance.",
