In the future, there will be a need for more rapid diagnoses, increased standardization of testing and greater adaptability to cope with new threats from infectious microorganisms, such as agents of bioterrorism and emerging pathogens. The combination of the new tools that are now being developed in research laboratories, the general reorganization of clinical laboratories and improved communication between physicians and clinical microbiologists should lead to profound changes in the way that clinical microbiologists work.",
