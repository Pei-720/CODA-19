Immunohistochemically, FIPV antigens were detected in the inflammatory foci of the leptomeninges, choroid plexus and ventricles in 3 of the 4 cats. In 3 cases, inflammatory foci mainly consisted of CD204-and Iba1-positive macrophages, and the FIPV antigens were found in the macrophages. In the other case which was negative for FIPV antigen, severe inflammation predominantly consisting of CD20-positive B lymphocytes was observed in the leptomeninges and subventricles, accompanied with diffuse proliferation of gemistocytic astrocytes. The difference in histopathology may reflect the inflammatory process or the strain variation of FIP virus.",

FCoV consists of two biotypes including feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and FIP virus (FIPV). FECV infection is asymptomatic or exclusively causes mild gastrointestinal clinical symptons, while FIPV causes fatal symptoms such as fever, anorexia, weight loss, abdominal distention and neurological symptoms in young cats [2, 13] . The clinical symptoms differ depending on the form and organ distribution of the lesion, and in cases with lesions in central nervous system, neurological symptoms such as depression, ataxia and seizures appear in 85% of cases [15] . It was assumed that FIPV originating from FECV acquired its monocyte-or macrophage-tropism responsible for viral dissemination and developed specific FIP lesions due to vasculitis [17, 18] .",
