Emerging infectious diseases are those with increasing incidence at local, regional, or international scales, and are spreading from epicenters to new geographic areas. The surveillance, study and control of EIDs is a complex interdisciplinary effort, crossing international borders and involving the collaborative efforts of scientists, clinicians, and political leaders from many disciplines and backgrounds to protect human health.",

      "original_text": "According to a comprehensive literature review performed by Taylor et al. (2001) at the Centre for Tropical Veterinary Medicine at the University of Edinburgh, 1415 species of infectious organisms known to be pathogenic to humans were identified. The human pathogens tabulated by this study included an assortment of 217 viruses and prions, 538 bacteria and rickettsia, 307 fungi, 66 protozoa and 287 helminths. The majority of these (61%) were zoonotic infections transmitted from animals to humans. Of the 175 pathogenic species associated with diseases considered to be \u0027emerging\u0027, 135 (75%) were zoonotic. The study found that protozoan and virus pathogens were particularly likely to emerge, and that the helminths were less likely to do so. Interestingly, no association was found between route of transmission and emergence in this study. An updated literature survey from the Centre for Infectious Diseases at the same institution (University of Edinburgh) was published in 2005 by Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria. This study identified 1407 species of human pathogens, 58% of which were zoonotic. Of the total, 177 were regarded as \u0027emerging\u0027 or \u0027re-emerging\u0027 pathogens. The emerging and re-emerging zoonotic pathogens were most likely to have the broadest host ranges. The authors noted that although zoonotic pathogens constitute a significant source for emerging and re-EIDs, only a small minority of them would prove capable of causing major epidemics in the human population -but the H5N1 influenza strain could prove to be an exception.",
