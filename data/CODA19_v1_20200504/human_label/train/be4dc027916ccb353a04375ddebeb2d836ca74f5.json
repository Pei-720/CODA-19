With the increase of concentration of Triton X-100 in the system, the intrinsic fluorescence intensity, synchronous fluorescence intensity, fluorescence polarization, zeta potential, and morphology of Hb all changed gradually, and the ribavirin located on the Hb surface was dissociated and released out. When the concentration of Triton X-100 was higher than 1×10 −5 mol⋅L −1 , the stronger interaction of Triton X-100 with Hb was predominant.",
