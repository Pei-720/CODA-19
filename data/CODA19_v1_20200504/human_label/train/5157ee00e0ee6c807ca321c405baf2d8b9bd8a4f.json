CD8 + T cells are potent effector cells that can produce high amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and kill infected target cells efficiently. However, a protective role for CD8 + T cells during Leishmania infections is still controversial and largely depends on the infection model. In this review, we discuss the role of CD8 + T cells during various types of Leishmania infections, following vaccination, and as potential immunotherapeutic targets.",
