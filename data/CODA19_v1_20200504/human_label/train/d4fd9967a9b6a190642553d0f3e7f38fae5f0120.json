We aimed to examine whether serum YKL-40 and growth factors could be markers for PIBO exacerbation. Thirtyseven children admitted with acute exacerbation of PIBO were enrolled and studied retrospectively. Diagnosis of PIBO was based on clinical history of acute respiratory infection followed by persistent airway obstruction and characteristic findings in high-resolution computed tomography. Serum levels of YKL-40, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB were measured on admission. The biomarkers were also examined in children admitted with acute bronchiolitis serving as positive controls (N \u003d 30) and in age-matched controls (N \u003d 20). Only YKL-40 levels were found to be significantly higher in PIBO patients with exacerbation compared with that in bronchiolitis patients and showed a positive correlation with the severity of disease before diagnosis of PIBO.",
