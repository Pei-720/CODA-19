The cardiac injury was dominate in the process. However, whether N terminal pro B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) predicted outcome of COVID-19 patients was unknown. The study initially enrolled 102 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia from a continuous sample. After screening out the ineligible cases, 54 patients were analyzed in this study. Results found that patients with higher NT-proBNP (above 88.64 pg/mL) level had more risks of inhospital death. After adjusting for potential cofounders in separate modes, NT-proBNP presented as an independent risk factor of in-hospital death in patients with severe COVID-19. : medRxiv preprint Figure 1. The NT-proBNP for in-hospital death of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The area under the curve (AUC) of NT-proBNP was 0.909.
