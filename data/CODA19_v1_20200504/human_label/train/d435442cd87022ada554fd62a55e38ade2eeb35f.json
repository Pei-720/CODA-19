Immunopathol., The lymphocyte populations of the bovine gut lamina proprial (LP) and epithelial tissues were isolated and characterized with respect to cells bearing surface and cytoplasmic immunoglobulin (Ig). Functional characteristics of cells from the two tissues, including responsiveness to Concanavalin A (Con A), anti-bovine immunoglobulin (anti-Ig), Con A supernatants of bovine peripheral blood lymphocytes (bConA sup) and recombinant human IL-2 (rhIL-2), were also assessed.",
