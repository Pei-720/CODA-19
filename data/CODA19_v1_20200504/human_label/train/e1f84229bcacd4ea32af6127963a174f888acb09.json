Towards understanding the function of the HEV macro domain, we characterized its interaction partners among other HEV encoded proteins. Here, we report that the HEV X-domain directly interacts with the viral methyltransferase and the ORF3 proteins. ORF3 association with the X-domain was mediated through two independent motifs, located within its N-terminal 35aa (amino acids) and C-terminal 63-123aa. Methyltransferase interaction domain was mapped to N-terminal 30-90aa. The X-domain interacted with both ORF3 and methyltransferase through its C-terminal region, involving 66 th ,67 th isoleucine and 101 st ,102 nd leucine, conserved across HEV genotypes. Furthermore, ORF3 and methyltransferase competed with each other for associating with the X-domain. These findings provide molecular understanding of the interaction between the HEV macro domain, methyltransferase and ORF3, suggesting an important role of the macro domain in the life cycle of HEV.",

The 5′ end has m7G cap 6 . The ORF1 encodes the nonstructural proteins: methyltransferase (Met), papain-like cysteine protease (PCP), helicase and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). It also codes for domains of unknown functions such as X, Y, V and DUF3729 domain 7 . HEV methyltransferase is able to catalyze the transfer of methyl group from S-adenosyl methionine to GTP, to yield m7GTP and also forms a covalent complex with m7GMP, indicating an associated guanylyltransferase activity 8, 9 . PCP has been reported to deubiquitinate interferon-stimulated gene-15 AMC (ubiquitin-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin) 8 . HEV helicase is a nucleoside triphosphatase with the ability to unwind RNA duplexes in the 5′ to 3′ direction 10,11 . Viral RdRp has been shown to be essential for viral replication 12,13 . ORF2 is an N-linked glycoprotein, which forms the viral capsid 14 . ORF2 glycosylation has been demonstrated to be important for the formation of infectious virus particles 15 . ORF2 binds to the 5′ -region of HEV genomic RNA 16 . It has been shown to induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and exploit the ER-associated degradation pathway to gain access to the cytoplasm where it inhibits the host NFκ B activity 17, 18 . The ORF3 is a small phosphoprotein situated between ORF1 and ORF2, overlapping ORF2. It binds to several host proteins and modulates their activity 19 . Importantly, it binds to the tumor susceptibility gene101 (TSG101) and mediates the release of the progeny virus 20,21 .",
