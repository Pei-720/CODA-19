Induction and retention of IL-15-independent memory CD8 + T cells was assessed in IL-15 À/À and wild-type (wt) mice immunized with recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) or Sindbis virus (rSIN) vectors expressing the identical foreign epitope. Both vectors induced epitope-specific CD8 + T cell expansion and function, independent of IL-15. Similar kinetics of rVV clearance confirmed effective CD8 + T cell function in IL-15 À/À mice. CD44 hi CD122 hi CD8 + T cells, mainly of the CD62L À/lo phenotype, increased more dramatically and declined more rapidly in IL-15 À/À mice, independent of the vector. Rapid IL-15-independent memory CD8 + T cell expansion following challenge of immune mice compensated for the limited memory CD8 + populations in IL-15 À/À mice. However, despite expansion and expression of potent effector function, viral clearance was delayed in the absence of IL-15, coinciding with a rapid loss in cytolytic function. D 2004 Elsevier Inc.
