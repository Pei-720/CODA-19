      "original_text": "Neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis is the most common serious gastrointestinal disorder encountered in neonatal intensive care units. It is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the newborn, particularly in premature infants. Consistent risk factors are birth weight and prematurity. Polycythemia and hyperviscosity altering blood flow and infectious agents are also implicated. Clinical findings include abdominal distention and diarrhea, and systemic symptoms such as apnea, acidosis, and lethargy. Pneumatosis intestinalis can be demonstrated radiographically. Mucosal ulcerations, hemorrhage, and thrombosis occur early, followed by inflammatory changes. Later still necrosis develops. Ischemia, infection, and enteral feedings are suspected to be involved in the pathophysiology. Eicosanoids, especially thromboxane, platelet-activating factor, and leukotrienes are likely mediators.",
