      "original_text": "The 5% nontranslated region (5%NTR) and nonstructural region nucleotide sequences of nine enzootic Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus strains were determined, thus completing the genomic RNA sequences of all prototype strains. The full-length genomes, representing VEE virus antigenic subtypes I -VI, range in size from 11.3 to 11.5 kilobases, with 48-53% overall G + C contents. Size disparities result from subtype-related differences in the number and length of direct repeats in the C-terminal nonstructural protein 3 (nsP3) domain coding sequence and the 3%NTR, while G + C content disparities are attributable to strain-specific variations in base composition at the wobble position of the polyprotein codons. Highly-conserved protein components and one nonconserved protein domain constitute the VEE virus replicase polyproteins. Approximately 80% of deduced nsP1 and nsP4 amino acid residues are invariant, compared to less than 20% of C-terminal nsP3 domain residues. In two enzootic strains, C-terminal nsP3 domain sequences degenerate into little more than repetitive serine-rich blocks. Nonstructural region sequence information drawn from a cross-section of VEE virus subtypes clarifies features of alphavirus conserved sequence elements and proteinase recognition signals. As well, whole-genome comparative analysis supports the reclassification of VEE subtype-variety IF and subtype II viruses.",
