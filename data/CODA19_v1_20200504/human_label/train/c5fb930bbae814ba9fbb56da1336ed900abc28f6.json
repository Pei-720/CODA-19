The monoclonal antibody was able to neutralize tile in vitro cytopathic effect of MHV-3 on cultured L2 cells, and was detected by indirect immunofluorescence on MHV-3-infected cultured Y AC cells. In addition, it conferred a significant protection against MHV-3-induced acute disease, if injected intraperitoneally to C57BL/6 mice before inoculation with MHV-3. ,",
