      "original_text": "The microarray is a platform with wide-ranging potential in biodefence. Owing to the high level of throughput attainable through miniaturization, microarrays have accelerated the ability to respond in an epidemic or crisis. Extending beyond diagnostics, recent studies have applied microarrays as a research tool towards understanding the etiology and pathogenicity of dangerous pathogens, as well as in vaccine development. The original emphasis was on DNA microarrays, but the range now includes protein, antibody and carbohydrate microarrays, and research groups have exploited this diversity to further extend microarray applications in the area of biodefence. Here, we discuss the impact and contributions of the growing range of microarrays and emphasize the concepts that might shape the future of biodefence research. 0167-7799/$ -see front matter ß",
