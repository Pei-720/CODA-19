      "original_text": "Background: Noncontact forehead temperature measurement by handheld infrared thermometer was used as a screening tool for fever. However, the accuracy data and normal range of forehead temperature determined by this method were not available. Methods: The temperature readings from 3 handheld infrared thermometers were validated against an electronic thermometer. Normal range of forehead temperature was determined by measuring the forehead temperature in 1000 apparently healthy subjects. Results: Significant differences were detected in readings obtained by the 3 different handheld infrared thermometers (analysis of covariance, P , .001) The most accurate one was chosen, and the normal range of forehead temperature in 1000 subjects detected by this method was 31.0°C to 35.6°C. Conclusions: Our study shows that commercially available, handheld infrared thermometers require individual validation. Forehead temperature in excess of 35.6°C is suggestive of fever. Further studies are required to confirm accuracy of this value in detecting fever. (Am J Infect Control 2005;33:227-9.) ",
