      "original_text": "From 2005 to 2013, 17 ferrets were diagnosed with mycobacteriosis at the authors\u0027 practices. Clinical findings included ocular, respiratory, and digestive abnormalities. Diagnosis was based on histopathology, specific histochemical stains, and/or on polymerase chain reaction. All bacteria identified belonged to the nontuberculous Mycobacterium complex. Several treatment protocols were attempted, frequently based on the use of enrofloxacin. In all, 3 ferrets were considered cured. Mycobacteriosis in ferrets is a polymorphous disease with diverse clinical presentations. It is also likely an underdiagnosed disease in pet ferrets, which appear to be particularly susceptible to environmental sources. Mycobacteriosis should be included in the differential diagnosis for ocular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal diseases; in particular, it should be differentiated from systemic coronavirus infection.",
