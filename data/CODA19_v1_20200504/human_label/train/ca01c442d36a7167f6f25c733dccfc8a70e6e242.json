      "original_text": "Autophagy is involved in various physiological processes, including starvation, cell differentiation and development, and degradation of aberrant structures, which ultimately maintains cellular homeostasis 9 . Moreover, autophagy is part of host stress responses such as the unfolded protein response (UPR) 10 . Given that viral infection and replication cause cell stress, autophagy is a frequent by-product of infection. However, autophagy during viral infection is not merely a passive process. As clearance of cytoplasmic components is a major function of autophagy, the innate immune system activates autophagy to degrade and dispose of invading viruses 11 . Furthermore, at later stages of infection, autophagy facilitates antigen processing and thereby the induction of adaptive immune responses 12,13 . There is a form of selective autophagy, xenophagy, that specifically recognizes intracellular microorganisms and targets them to autophagosomes for degradation 14 . Despite the seemingly hazardous conditions in autophagosomes for viruses, some viruses convert the autophagosome to their home for replication. The autophagosome provides a membrane-bound, protected environment to generate their progeny, and viruses can use autophagy-generated metabolites and energy for replication. Another type of autophagy, termed lipophagy, is a degradation pathway for lipid droplets in cells, and viruses can also hijack this process 15 . Lipid droplets are an ideal platform for virion assembly, and viruses can directly activate lipophagy to maintain the high level of ATP required for viral replication. In summary, current evidence suggests that viruses have evolved diverse strategies to either combat or utilize autophagy to promote their own life cycle. In this Review, we provide an overview of the function of autophagy as an antiviral defence mechanism and then focus on how viruses subvert and Multivesicular bodies (MVBs).
