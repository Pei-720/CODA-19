Methods: Two hundred ninety-nine respiratory samples were prospectively explored using multiplex molecular techniques (FilmArray Respiratory Panel, Clart Pneumovir), immunological techniques (direct fluorescent assay, lateral flow chromatography) and cell cultures. Findings: Molecular techniques permitted the recovery of up to 50% more respiratory pathogens in comparison to non-molecular methods. FilmArray detected at least 30% more pathogens than Clart Pneumovir which could be explained by the differences in their technical designs. The turnaround time under 2 hours for the FilmArray permitted delivery of results when patients were still in the emergency room.",
