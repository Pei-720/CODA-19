ARFs have several important functions, including the recruitment of coat proteins that promote sorting of cargo into vesicles, the recruitment and activation of enzymes, such as the phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) kinases, that alter membrane lipid composition, and interaction with cytoskeletal factors (TABLE 1) . There are six mammalian ARF proteins that can be divided into three classes based on sequence homology: Class I (ARF1, ARF2 and ARF3), Class II (ARF4 and ARF5) and Class III (ARF6) (FIG. 1) . The Class II ARFs arose late in animal cell evolution, possibly in metazoans, but Class I ARFs are highly conserved and are present in all eukaryotes examined to date. Hence, in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, each class has a single ARF orthologue, but yeast lacks the Class II ARFs. Plants have Class I ARFs, and potentiall y also Class III ARFs (BOX 1).",
