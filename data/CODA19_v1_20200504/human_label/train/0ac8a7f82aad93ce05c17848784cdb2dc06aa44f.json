      "original_text": "Rev DDX3 DDX5 RNA helicase RNA export a b s t r a c t RNA helicase plays an important role in host mRNA and viral mRNA transcription, transport, and translation. Many viruses utilize RNA helicases in their life cycle, while human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) does not encode an RNA helicase. Thus, host RNA helicase has been involved in HIV-1 replication. Indeed, DDX1 and DDX3 DEAD-box RNA helicases are known to be required for efficient HIV-1 Revdependent RNA export. However, it remains unclear whether distinct DDX RNA helicases cross-talk and cooperate to modulate the HIV-1 Rev function. In this study, we noticed that distinct DDX RNA helicases, including DDX1, DDX3, DDX5, DDX17, DDX21, DDX56, except DDX6, bound to the Rev protein and they colocalized with Rev in nucleolus or nucleus. In this context, these DEAD-box RNA helicases except DDX6 markedly enhanced the HIV-1 Rev-dependent RNA export. Furthermore, DDX3 interacted with DDX5 and synergistically enhanced the Rev function. As well, combination of other distinct DDX RNA helicases cooperated to stimulate the Rev function. Altogether, these results suggest that distinct DDX DEAD-box RNA helicases cooperate to modulate the HIV-1 Rev function.",
