It started out as a great scientifi c endeavor in the 1990s which aimed to sequence the complete genomes of certain biological species. However viruses are not new to this fi eld as complete viral genomes have routinely been sequenced since the past thirty years. The \u0027genomic era\u0027 has been said to have revolutionized biology. This knowledge of full genomes has created the fi eld of functional genomics in today\u0027s post-genomic era, which, is in most part concerned with the studies on the expression of the organism\u0027s genome under different conditions. This article is an attempt to introduce its readers to the application of functional genomics to address and answer several complex biological issues in virus research.",
