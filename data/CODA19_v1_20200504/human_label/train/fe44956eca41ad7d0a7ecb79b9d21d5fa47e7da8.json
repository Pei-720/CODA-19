      "original_text": "The purposes of this study were to determine if the successful treatment of bovine respiratory disease (BRD) in suckling calves was associated with a long-term increase in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) and, to screen for associations between blood leukogram variables and mPAP. A cohort of Red Angus calves (n \u003d 74) were followed from birth to weaning at an altitude of 975 m. Calves were weaned at 172 ± 14 d when their mPAP was measured and whole blood collected. Thirty calves that had been treated for BRD (34 to 45 d prior) and 30 calves that had not required treatment for BRD were sampled. Treatment for BRD had no effect on mPAP (P \u003d 0.37). Mean mPAP was 48 ± 8 mm Hg (± SD) with a minimum of 34 mm Hg and a maximum at 69 mm Hg. Weaning weight and sex tended to be associated with mPAP, but they explained just 5% of the variation in mPAP (P \u003d 0.08; Adj. r 2 \u003d 0.05). Fibrinogen (P \u003d 0.008) and absolute lymphocyte count (P \u003d 0.06) were negatively associated with mPAP, whereas absolute monocyte count was positively associated with mPAP (P \u003d 0.01). The findings of this study suggest that pre-weaning treatment for BRD does not increase a calves\u0027 post-weaning risk of congestive right heart failure. Further, components of the immune and acute phase response system may play a role in the development and progression of pulmonary hypertension.",
