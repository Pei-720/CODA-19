Importantly, they inhibit proteins which are not targeted by existing antiviral therapies, for example, Vpu of HIV type 1, p7 of hepatitis C virus, E of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of coxsackievirus B3. BIT225, developed by Biotron Limited, is the first acylguanidine in clinical trials against HIV type 1 and hepatitis C virus. In this article we focus on the mechanisms of inhibition of viral proteins by acylguanidines.",
