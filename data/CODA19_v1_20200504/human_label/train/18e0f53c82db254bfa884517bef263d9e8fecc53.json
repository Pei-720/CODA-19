      "original_text": "Toona sinensis (TS), which is also known as Cedrela sinensis, belongs to Meliaceae family, the compounds identified from this TS leaves possess a wide range of biologic functions, such as hypoglycemic effects, anti-LDL glycative activity, antioxidant activities, and inhibition of sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus replication. However, their effect against cancer cells is not well explored. In this study, to understand the cytotoxic effect and molecular mechanism stimulated by TSL-1 (TS leaf extract fraction) we employed three different non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines: H441 cells (lung adenocarcinoma), H661 cells (lung large cell carcinoma) and H520 cells (lung squamous cell carcinoma). IC50 value was varied between these three cell lines, the least IC 50 value was observed in TSL-1-treated H661cells. Exposure of NSCLC cells to TSL-1 caused cell-cycle arrest in subG1 phase and caused apoptosis. Moreover, TSL-1 treatment decreased the cell-cycle regulators; cyclin D1 and CDK4 proteins by up regulating p27 expression in a dosedependent manner. Thus, the TSL-1-induced apoptosis was further confirmed by cell morphology, subG1 peak accumulation, poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, propidium iodide (PI)-Annexin-V double staining, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay. The decreased Bcl2 protein level was concurrent with an increased Bax protein level in all 3 cell lines. Additionally, the tumoricidal effect of TSL-1 was measured using a xenograft model, after 5 weeks of TSL-1 treatment by various regimen caused regression of tumor. Taken together both these in vitro and in vivo studies revealed that TSL-1 is a potent inhibitor against NSCLC growth and our provoking result suggest that TSL-1 can be a better nutriceutical as a singlet or along withdoublet agents (taxane, vinorelbine, and gemcitabine) for treating NSCLC.
