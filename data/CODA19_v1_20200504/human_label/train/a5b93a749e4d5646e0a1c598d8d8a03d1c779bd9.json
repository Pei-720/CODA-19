      "original_text": "Common ventilation strategies may fail to maintain indoor air quality when atmosphere is heavily polluted by particulate matter. This paper evaluates the performances of common constant air volume (CAV) system and variable air volume (VAV) system when carbon dioxide and particles are significantly present in outdoor environment. Major system parameters including filter efficiency, occupancy number, ventilation air rate, and outdoor particle concentration are thoroughly examined. Firstly, a full-scale chamber experiment is performed to investigate the dynamics of CO 2 and airborne particles under steady and non-steady scenarios. The result is further validated with a previously-developed state-space model. Secondly, an exhaustive case study is conducted using an established mathematical model. In order to reduce CO 2 concentration, both CAV and CO 2 -based demand-controlled VAV may cause an undesirable increase in particle concentration when outdoor air is heavily polluted by particles. This dilemma requires further studies on the optimization of ventilation schemes.",
