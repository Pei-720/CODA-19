However, alprostadil (10 μg/kg) treatment significantly reduced OA-induced elevation of these indicators. Additionally, OA-induced expression of TNF-a and IL-1b were suppressed by alprostadil. The OA-induced activation of nuclear factor (NF) kB p65 was also reduced by alprostadil. Furthermore, we found that Alprostadil had an inhibitory effect on the phosphorylation of JNK, ERK1/2, and p38 MAPKs. Alprostadil inhibited Bax but increased Bcl-2, indicating a suppressive role in apoptosis. Remarkably increased expression of ACE in the OA model group was observed, which was decreased by alprostadil.",
