In addition, they shed coronavirus-like particles (CVLPs) in their feces which are morphologically distinct from \"typical\" coronaviruses. 0ronasal, intraperitoneal, intraduodenal, and intravenous inoculations of CVLPs were uniformly unsuccessful in the seroconversion of eats to CV, whereas subsequent prolonged close contact with colony eats did result in seroconversion. Such evidence indicates that MD eats in this barrier colony are infected with at least two non-crossreactive agents: (1) feline enteric CVLPs, which are shed in feces and are morphologically and antigenicMly distinct from established coronaviruses (CVs), and (2) a virus which is antigenically cross-reactive with CVs, but which is apparently shed by some route other than the lower gastrointestinal tract.",
