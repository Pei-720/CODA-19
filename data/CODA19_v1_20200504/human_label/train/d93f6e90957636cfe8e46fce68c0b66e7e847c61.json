      "original_text": "Escherichia coli O157:H7, an important food-borne pathogen, has become a major public health concern worldwide. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular epidemiologic feature of E. coli O157:H7 strains in China. 105 E. coli O157:H7 isolates were collected from various hosts and places over 9 years. A multilocus sequence typing scheme (MLST) was applied for bacteria genotyping and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for virulence factor identification. Seven new MLST sequence types (STs), namely ST836, ST837, ST838, ST839, ST840, ST841, and ST842 were identified, which grouped into two lineages. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the most two frequent STs in China, ST837 and ST836, may be the derivatives of E. coli O157:H7 Sakai or E. coli O157:H7 EDL933. Geographical diversity and host variety of E. coli O157:H7 were observed in China. In addition, the different distribution of tccp was detected. The data presented herein provide new insights into the molecular epidemiologic feature of E. coli O157:H7, and aid in the investigation of the transmission regularity and evolutionary mechanism of E. coli O157:H7.",
