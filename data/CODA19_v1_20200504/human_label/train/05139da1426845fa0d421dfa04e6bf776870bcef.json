Sulfite 4 worked as a practical monomer for the preparation of (1 ? 2)-linked polysaccharide skeletons. The chemical stability of 4 was evaluated by the comparison of thermodynamic parameters with those of conventional epoxide (2). The grafting reaction of 4 from glycyrrhetic acid (5) was performed in the presence of TfOH and MS 3A in CH 2 Cl 2 at room temperature. The polymerization degree was moderately controllable by the change of feed ratio of initiator.",
