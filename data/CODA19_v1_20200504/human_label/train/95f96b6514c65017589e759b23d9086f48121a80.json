      "original_text": "The methods of repeated immunization with inactivated vaccines have been used widely to increase antibody protection against infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). However, compared with DNA vaccines, these methods usually induce poor cellular responses. In the present study, specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens were immunized intramuscularly with a DNA vaccine carrying the main IBV structural genes (pVAX1-S1, pVAX1-M, and pVAX1-N, respectively) and boosted with the IBV M41 strain inactivated vaccine to assess whether such a new strategy could enhance the immune responses against IBV. The protection efficacy of the DNA vaccine carrying different structural genes for priming was evaluated further. The chickens were immunized primely on day 7 and boosted 2 weeks later. After that, distribution of the DNA vaccine in vivo, the percentage of CD4+CD3+ and CD8+CD3+ subgroups of peripheral blood T-lymphocytes, and the specific IgG and virus neutralizing antibodies were measured. Chickens were then challenged by the nasal-ocular route with the IBV M41 strain 4 weeks after booster immunization. The results demonstrated that priming with a DNA vaccine encoding nucleocapsid protein (pVAX1-N) and boosting with the inactivated IBV vaccine led to the dramatic augmentation of humoral and cellular responses, and provided up to 86.7% rate of immune protection, providing an effective approach to protect chickens from IBV.",
