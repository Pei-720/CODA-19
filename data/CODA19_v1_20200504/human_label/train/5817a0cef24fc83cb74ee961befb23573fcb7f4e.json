      "original_text": "Healthcare management is currently undergoing substantial changes, and reshaping our perception of the medical field. One spectrum is that of the considerable changes that we see in surgical machines and equipment, and the way the procedures are performed. Computing power, Internet and associated technologies are transforming surgical operations into model based procedures. The other spectrum is the management side of healthcare, which is equally critical to the medical profession. In particular, recent advances in the field of Information Technology (IT) is assisting in better management of health appointments and record management. With the proliferation of IT and management, data is now playing a vital role in diagnostics, drug administration and management of healthcare services. With the advancement in data processing, large amounts of medical data collected by medical centres and providers, can now be mined and analysed to assist in planning and making appropriate decisions. In this article, we shall provide an overview of the role of IT that have been reshaping the healthcare management, hospital, health profession and industry.",
