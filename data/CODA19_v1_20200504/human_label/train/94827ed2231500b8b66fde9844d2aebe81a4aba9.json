We want to investigate mechanism of niclosamide inducing cell apoptosis in HCC. Methods: Two hepatoma cell lines were used to evaluate activity of niclosamide inducing cell apoptosis and study its mechanism. Quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting were used in analysis of genes expression or protein active regulated by niclosamide.",
