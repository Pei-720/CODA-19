      "original_text": "Background: Despite growing evidence suggesting potential association between innate and adaptive immunity in viral-induced acute asthma, there is paucity of data in this area. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the association of innate and adaptive immunity with acute asthma attacks by analysing the role of IFN-␥-inducible protein 10 (IP-10), TLR2, cathelicidin, vitamin D and cytokines. Material and methods: This prospective study included 33 patients with viral-induced acute asthma and 30 children with controlled asthma. Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected for virus identification and asthma attack scores assessed in acute asthma group. Blood sampling for IP-10, TLR2, cathelicidin, vitamin D levels, and spirometric indices were employed. Results: Serum IP-10 and cathelicidin levels of acute asthma group were significantly higher and vitamin D levels were lower than controlled asthma group (IP-10; p \u003d 0.006, cathelicidin; p \u003d 0.002, vitamin D; p \u003c 0.001). Serum IP-10 levels showed a significant negative correlation with age (p \u003d 0.009), TLR2 (p \u003d 0.05) and spirometric indices (p \u003d 0.002) in all asthmatics and a significant positive correlation with parameters of asthma attack severity (p \u003d 0.03) in acute asthma group. Higher cathelicidin values showed significant positive relation to IP-10 (beta coefficient: 33, p \u003d 0.02). Serum IP-10 levels higher than 38.9 pg/ml (sensitivity: 85%, The relation of IP-10 and cathelicidin with acute asthma attacks 161 specificity: 47%, p \u003d 0.002) were predictive of virus-induced asthma. Serum IP-10 and vitamin D levels were found to be significantly related to viral-asthma attacks (IP-10; aOR: 8.93, p \u003d 0.03 and vitamin D; aOR: 0.82, p \u003d 0.001). Conclusions: Innate immunity biomarkers such as serum IP-10 and cathelicidin can be used to predict viral-induced acute asthma. These biomarkers may provide potential new treatment targets for acute asthma.",
