General information 1 H NMR were taken in CDCl 3 , CD 3 OD or D 2 O on the following spectrometers: Varian Mercury-300 and Bruker Avance III (600 MHz) with TMS as an internal standard; chemical shifts δ in ppm with respect to TMS; coupling constants J in Hz. 13 C NMR spectra were recorded for CDCl 3 , CD 3 OD or DMSO-d 6 solutions on a Varian Mercury-300 and Bruker Avance III (600 MHz) spectrometer at 75.5 and 150.5 MHz, respectively. 31 P NMR spectra were taken in CDCl 3 , CD 3 OD or D 2 O on Varian Mercury-300 at 121.5 MHz. IR spectral data were measured on an Infinity MI-60 FT-IR spectrometer. Melting points were determined on a Boetius apparatus and are uncorrected. Elemental analyses were performed by the Microanalytical Laboratory of this Faculty on a Perkin Elmer PE 2400 CHNS analyzer. The following adsorbents were used: column chromatography, Merck silica gel 60 (70-230 mesh); analytical TLC, Merck TLC plastic sheets silica gel 60 F 254 . TLC plates were developed in chloroform−methanol solvent systems. Visualisation of spots was effected with",
