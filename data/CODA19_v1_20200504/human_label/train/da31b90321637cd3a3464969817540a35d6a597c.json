This sensing platform relies on graphene oxide (GO) surfaces conjugated with anti-human tau antibody to provide quantitative binding sites for the tau protein. The GO quenches standard fluorescein isothiocyanate labelled tau (tau-FITC) when tau protein and tau-FITC are both present and compete for the binding sites. This change in fluorescence signal can be used to quantitate tau protein.",

This approach could be developed into a promising biosensor for the detection of tau protein and may be useful in the clinical diagnosis of tau-induced neurodegeneration syndromes.",
