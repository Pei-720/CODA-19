      "original_text": "The objectives of the present study were to assess the mucosal, cellular, and humoral immune responses induced by two different infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) vaccination regimes and their efficacy against challenge by a variant IBV Q1. One-day-old broiler chicks were vaccinated with live H120 alone (group I) or in combination with CR88 (group II). The two groups were again vaccinated with CR88 at 14 days of age (doa). One group was kept as the control (group III). A significant increase in lachrymal IgA levels was observed at 4 doa and then peaked at 14 doa in the vaccinated groups. The IgA levels in group II were significantly higher than those in group I from 14 doa. Using immunohistochemistry to examine changes in the number of CD4 ؉ and CD8 ؉ cells in the trachea, it was found that overall patterns of CD8 ؉ cells were dominant compared to those of CD4 ؉ cells in the two vaccinated groups. CD8 ؉ cells were significantly higher in group II than those in group I at 21 and 28 doa. All groups were challenged oculonasally with a virulent Q1 strain at 28 doa, and their protection was assessed. The two vaccinated groups gave excellent ciliary protection against Q1, although group II\u0027s histopathology lesion scores and viral RNA loads in the trachea and kidney showed greater levels of protection than those in group I. These results suggest that greater protection is achieved from the combined vaccination of H120 and CR88 of 1-day-old chicks, followed by CR88 at 14 doa.",
