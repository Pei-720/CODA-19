      "original_text": "Bidens pilosa L. is an edible herb and has been traditionally used for a wide range of ailments in many countries. The aim of this review is to present comprehensive information of the chemical constituents, nutraceutical and ethnomedical uses as well as the biological and pharmacological effects and toxicity of this plant based on 218 literary sources reported over 40 years. Major chemical constituents (including 301 compounds) belonging to polyacetylenes, polyacetylene glycosides, flavonoids, flavone glycosides, aurones, chalcones, okanin glycosides, phenolic acids, terpenes, pheophytins, fatty acids and phytosterols have been identified or isolated from the different parts of this plant. Many of them have been considered as the bioactive compounds which are potentially responsible for the pharmacological actions. Various types of preparations, extracts and individual compounds derived from this plant have been found to possess biological and pharmacological activities such as anti-malarial, anti-allergy, antihypertensive and smooth muscle relaxant, anti-cancerogenic, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, antioxidant. The results of data analysis on the chemicals, pharmacological and toxicological characteristics of B. pilosa validate the view of its folk worldwide-medicinal uses. This herb has a great beneficial therapeutic property and is possibly used for complement or alternative to pharmaceutical drugs in some specific cases. However, this herb is known as hyperaccumulator and as-excluder; therefore, harvesting the herb for medicinal uses should be judiciously cautioned.",
