      "original_text": "Contact history is crucial during an infectious disease outbreak and vital when seeking to understand and predict the spread of infectious diseases in human populations. e transmission connectivity networks of people infected with highly contagious Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia were assessed to identify super-spreading events among the infected patients between 2012 and 2016. Of the 1379 MERS cases recorded during the study period, 321 (23.3%) cases were linked to hospital infection, out of which 203 (14.7%) cases occurred among healthcare workers. ere were 1113 isolated cases while the number of recorded contacts per MERS patient is between 1 (n � 210) and 17 (n � 1), with a mean of 0.27 (SD � 0.76). Five super-important nodes were identified based on their high number of connected contacts worthy of prioritization (at least degree of 5). e number of secondary cases in each SSE varies (range, 5-17). e eigenvector centrality was significantly (p \u003c 0.05) associated with place of exposure, with hospitals having on average significantly higher eigenvector centrality than other places of exposure. Results suggested that being a healthcare worker has a higher eigenvector centrality score on average than being nonhealthcare workers. Pathogenic droplets are easily transmitted within a confined area of hospitals; therefore, control measures should be put in place to curtail the number of hospital visitors and movements of nonessential staff within the healthcare facility with MERS cases.",
