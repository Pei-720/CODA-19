      "original_text": "KEYWORDS headspace gas chromatography mass spectrometry; three-dimensional printing porous scaffold; 1,4-dioxane Summary Background/Objective: A novel porous scaffold poly (lactide-co-glycolide) and tricalcium phosphate (PLGA/TCP) was developed by three-dimensional printing technology for bone defect repair. As a Class 2 solvent with less severe toxicity, content of residual 1,4dioxane in this newly developed scaffold should be rigorously controlled when it is translated to clinical use. In this study, a headspace gas chromatography-mass spectrometric (HS-GC-MS) method and related testing protocol were developed for quantitative determination of 1,4dioxane in the PLGA/TCP composite scaffolds. Methods: Matrix effect analysis was used to optimise the pretreatment method of the scaffolds. Then, the procedure for testing 1,4-dioxane using HS-GC-MS was set up. The accuracy, precision, and robustness of this newly developed quantitative method were also validated before quantification of 1,4-dioxane in the scaffolds with different drying procedures. Results: Dimethyl formamide (DMF) was the optimal solvent for dissolving scaffolds for GC-MS with proper sensitivity and without matrix effect. Then, the optimised procedure was determined as: the scaffolds were dissolved in DMF and kept at 90 C for 40 minutes, separated on a HP-5MS column, and detected by mass spectroscopy.
