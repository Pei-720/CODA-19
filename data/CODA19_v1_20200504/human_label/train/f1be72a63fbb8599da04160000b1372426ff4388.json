These forces have been an impetus for laboratorians to communicate, cooperate, and collaborate as never before and to seek the common ground where knowledge and resources can be shared to weather the profound economic and political forces at work today. The appearance of newly emerging and reemergent infections caused by agents of foodborne illness, anthrax, smallpox, plague, influenza, and other diseases has fostered cooperative network enterprises between clinical and public health laboratories, allowing the early detection of outbreaks of common and unusual pathogens and the measurement of the effectiveness of public health measures.",
