      "original_text": "Background: Low respiratory hygiene compliance among health care workers of emergency departments has become a major concern in the spread of respiratory infections. Our objective was to determine the compliance with respiratory hygiene of triage nurses at 2 university hospital centers and to identify factors influencing compliance to the respiratory hygiene principles of emergency health care workers. Methods: A 2-part, cross-sectional, descriptive study was conducted at 2 training centers. An anonymous observation of compliance with respiratory hygiene by triage emergency nurses was performed. A selfadministered, voluntary questionnaire on attitudes, perceptions, and knowledge of respiratory hygiene guidelines was distributed to the health care workers at the emergency department of the 2 hospital sites. Results: Median objective compliance with respiratory hygiene measures of triage nurses was 22% (interquartile range [IQR], 11%-33%). Median perceived compliance of the health care workers was 68% (IQR, 61%-79%). Median actual knowledge score was 75% (IQR, 75%-100%). Overall, 91.9% of respondents believed that the mask was an effective preventive measure. The main obstacles toward mask wearing by the health care worker were \"tendency to forget\" (37.8%) and \"discomfort\" (35.1%). Conclusion: The compliance rate at our institution is very low. We identified a few factors affecting adherence to respiratory hygiene measures that are of potential use in targeting groups and formulating recommendations.",
