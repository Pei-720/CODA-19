Cell cultures were inoculated with feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) or sham inoculum. The tissue samples of liver, kidney and spleen were taken from specific-pathogen-free (SPF) cats that were inoculated intranasally with 103 TCIDso of FIPV 79-1146 (n\u003d 10), FIPV UCD1 (n\u003d3) or sham inoculum (n \u003d 3), from clinical cats (n \u003d 43), and from formalin-fixed archived feline tissues (n \u003d 49), respectively. Additional tissue samples were taken from the FIPV-inoculated cats (n \u003d 6) and were kept at 4°C, room temperatures (20-24°C) and 370(2 respectively for 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours before frozen ( -70°C) for PCR to evaluate the effects of the ambient temperatures and post-mortem intervals on the test. The samples were also fixed in 10% neutrally buffered formalin, 95% ethanol, and Bouin\u0027s solution respectively to evaluate the effects of the fixatives on the test.",

There was no significant difference in the PCR results between the fresh and the formalin-fixed tissues of the clinical cats (P \u003e 0.05). Of the FIPV inoculated cats, the virus was detectable equally well in fresh and formalin-, Bouin\u0027s solution-or ethanol-fixed tissues. However, the amounts of total RNA extracted from the fixed tissues were significantly less than those from fresh tissues (P \u003c 0.01 ). In tissues that were kept at 4°C, the virus was detectable up to 96 h; at room temperatures, up to 48 h; and at 370C, up to 24 h, respectively. 0378-I 135/94/$07 00 © 1994 Elsevier Science B.V All fights reserved SSDI0378-1 135 (94)00043-V",
