With the emergence of the 2019 novel human coronavirus (2019-nCoV), healthcare systems worldwide are scrambling to meet the demands of a growing outbreak. Much akin to the appearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS CoV), the ultimate scope and reach of the outbreak is fluid and presently unknown. Unlike Ebola virus disease, with its high infectivity and high mortality, no uniform demand exists for assessment and treatment of 2019-nCoV infected patients in designated unique pathogen unit (UPU) settings. Regardless, the evolving understanding of transmission dynamics and the increasing international case load, coupled with growing fear and misinformation, results in formidable pressure on healthcare systems to maximize patient triage, staffing, confirmatory testing, communication, use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and patient placement. In the face of immense challenges, maximum and relentless standardization of base operational processes serves as the bedrock for nuanced, nimble responsiveness to real-time threats.",
