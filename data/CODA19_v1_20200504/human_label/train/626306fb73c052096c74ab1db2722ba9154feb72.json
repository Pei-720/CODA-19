Here we have presented evidence to support this idea in the case of growth factor receptor-like molecules and related oncogenes. It is therefore possible that these data might aid in understanding the way in which cellular genes interact in the control of normal proliferation. Our results indicate that some receptor-like oncogenes depend on ras proteins while some cytoplasmic oncogenes do not. There are, of course, numerous oncogenes which we have not yet tested which might behave differently from those described here. With this limitation in mind and on the basis of our present data, we propose that an important class of proliferative signals are received at the cell surface by receptor molecules such as growth factor receptors, and the c-ras proteins are essential in the transfer of these signals to cytoplasmic effectors having serine kinase activity; the effectors then modify target molecules which are directly involved in initiating a proliferative cycle. Accordingly, if the cytoplasmic effector were mutated such that it functioned without activation, proliferation would continue independently of c-ras proteins. Receptor molecules, on the other hand, would always require c-ras to stimulate proliferation.",
