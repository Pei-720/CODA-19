      "original_text": "Cardio-vascular diseases are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Ischemia is a state of oxygen deprivation in tissues, whereas reperfusion is restoration of blood flow in ischemic tissues. Myocardial damage of tissue during reperfusion after ischemic insult is known as myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. It induces damage to cardiac muscle via increasing expression of oxygen, sodium and calcium ions which are responsible in the activation of proteases and cell death. Heart renin angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in the myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury. Angiotensin (1-7) is responsible for vasodilation and angiotensin II for vasoconstriction. Here-in we reviewed how myocardial I/R injury sets in by up-regulation of angiotensin II that leads to increased infarct size, which can be reduced by the use of ACE inhibitors, ACE2 activators and angiotensin II antagonist. ß",
