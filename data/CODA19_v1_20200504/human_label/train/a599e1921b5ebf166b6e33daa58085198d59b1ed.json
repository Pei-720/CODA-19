      "original_text": ": A total of 377 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were enrolled in this study, including 117 with severe pneumonia and 260 with non-severe pneumonia. The independent risk factors for severe pneumonia were age [odds ratio (OR): 1.059, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.036-1.082; p \u003c 0.001], N/L (OR: 1.322, 95% CI: 1.180-1.481; p \u003c 0.001), CRP (OR: 1.231, 95% CI: 1.129-1.341; p \u003d 0.002), and D-dimer (OR: 1.059, 95% CI: 1.013-1.107; p \u003d 0.011). We identified a product of N/L*CRP*D-dimer as having an important predictive value for the severity of COVID-19. The cutoff value was 5.32. The negative predictive value of less than 5.32 for the N/L*CRP*D-dimer was 93.75%, while the positive predictive value was 46.03% in the test sets. The sensitivity and specificity were 89.47% and 67.42%. In the training sets, the negative and positive predictive values were 93.80% and 41.32%, respectively, with a specificity of 70.76% and a sensitivity of 89.87%. Conclusions: A product of N/L*CRP*D-dimer may be an important predictor of disease severity in patients with COVID-19.",
