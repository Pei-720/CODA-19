The 20th annual CVS (25-28 April, 2004) was attended by 727 clinical virologists and other interested individuals, while 304 attended the Workshop (23-24 April, 2004). Both meetings are organized by the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology (PASCV) and the University of South Florida College of Medicine. The gatherings are characterized by the high quality and focus of the presentations, lively question and answer sessions, and (not least) the meeting location in a modest older hotel on a beautiful Gulf of Mexico beach.",
