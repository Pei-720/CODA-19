      "original_text": "The host antiviral response involves the induction of interferons and proinflammatory cytokines, but also the activation of cell death pathways, including apoptosis, to limit viral replication and spreading. This host defense is strictly regulated to eliminate the infection while limiting tissue damage that is associated with virus pathogenesis. Post-translational modifications, most notably phosphorylation, are key regulators of the antiviral defense implying an important role of protein phosphatases. Here, we investigated the role of the dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) in the host defense against human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a pathogenic virus of the Pneumoviridae family, and Sendai virus (SeV), a model virus being developed as a vector for anti-RSV vaccine. We found that DUSP1 is upregulated before being subjected to proteasomal degradation. DUSP1 does not inhibit the antiviral response, but negatively regulates virus-induced JNK/p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Interaction with the JNK-interacting protein 1 scaffold protein prevents dephosphorylation of JNK by DUSP1, likely explaining that AP-1 activation and downstream cytokine production are protected from DUSP1 inhibition. Importantly, DUSP1 promotes SeV-induced apoptosis and suppresses cell migration in RSVinfected cells. Collectively, our data unveils a previously unrecognized selective role of DUSP1 in the regulation of tissue damage and repair during infections by RSV and SeV.",

We demonstrate that DUSP1 is a negative regulator of RSV-and SeV-induced JNK/p38 MAPK phosphorylation. However, this function is neither linked to the inhibition of the antiviral response nor to the induction of a cytokine and chemokine response elicited during virus infection. Interestingly, we found that interaction of JNK by the JNK interacting protein (JIP) 1 scaffold protein, previously shown to be critical for AP-1 and downstream cytokine production specifically, protects JNK from dephosphorylation by DUSP1. Although we confirmed that a JNK/p38 signalling module is involved in the induction of virus-induced apoptosis, our data suggests that DUSP1 has a pro-apoptotic function independently of JNK and p38 during SeV infection. Finally, we found that DUSP1 dampens cell migration during RSV infection. Altogether, these findings point to a previously unrecognized role of DUSP1 in functions that have an impact on virus-associated tissue damage and repair.",
