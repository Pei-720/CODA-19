The target compounds were evaluated for their antiviral potential and found to inhibit several coronaviruses. Significantly, compound 2 displayed selective antiviral activity (CC 50 \u003e3Â EC 50 ) towards human coronavirus (HCoV)-NL63 and Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus, but not severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus. In the case of HCoV-NL63 the activity was highly promising with an EC 50 \u003c10 lM and a CC 50 \u003e100 lM. As such, these doubly flexible nucleoside analogues are viewed as a novel new class of drug candidates with potential for potent inhibition of coronaviruses.",

The current MERS outbreak has been ongoing for almost three years, with well over a thousand confirmed cases having been documented, with a mortality rate of about 40%. 1 Since the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, there have been extensive efforts to target the coronavirus family, including the screening of libraries of already approved antiviral drugs such as acyclovir (ACV), ganciclovir, lamivudine, and zidovudine. Unfortunately, none of these well known antiviral drugs exhibited any activity against SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV in vitro. 2 The SARS-CoV screening efforts did, however, yield a small number of leads including the nucleoside analogue ribavirin, a guanosine-like analogue that has exhibited broad-spectrum antiviral activity. 2-7 Ribavirin was found to inhibit coronavirus replication in vitro, but with an inhibitory concentration much higher (500-5000 lg/ml) than that needed to inhibit other viruses (50-100 lg/ml). Consequently, it does not appear to represent a viable treatment option. Moreover, a recent study has suggested that in the case of the coronaviruses, ribavirin\u0027s antiviral activity is not primarily due to lethal mutagenesis, but rather to its effect on the cell\u0027s GTP biosynthesis. 8 Beyond these studies, there are very few reports of (novel) nucleoside inhibitors being studied or developed to combat coronavirus infection.",
