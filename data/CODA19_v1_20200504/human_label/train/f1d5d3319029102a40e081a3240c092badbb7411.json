We found that the supernatants of human PBMCs stimulated by BW001 significantly protected Vero cells from SARS-CoV infection. BW001 could stimulate human PBMCs and pDCs to secrete high level of IFN-a and promote human PBMCs and B cells to proliferate. Furthermore, we demonstrated that BW001 could activate CD19 + B cells and CD56 + NK cells in human PBMCs. In addition, BW001 could enhance NK cytotoxicity and IFN-g secretion in human PBMCs. Together, BW001 represents a novel type of CpG ODN and may have potential for the development of treatment and prevention for SARS as well as other viral associated diseases. D",
