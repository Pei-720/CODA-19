Based on his clinical history, elevated serum cardiac enzyme values, and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and myocardial biopsy findings, he was diagnosed with myocarditis induced by nivolumab. Corticosteroid therapy improved his condition, and CMR performed on hospital day 11 also showed remarkable improvement. Although nivolumab-induced myocarditis is rare, cardiologists should consider it when encountering patients treated with such a drug for malignant disease.",
