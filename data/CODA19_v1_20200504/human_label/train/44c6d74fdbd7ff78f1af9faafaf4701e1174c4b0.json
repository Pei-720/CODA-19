      "original_text": "The evolutionary history of the Astroviridae comprises the ancient separation between avian and mammalian astrovirus lineages followed by diversification among mammalian astroviruses. The latter process included several cross-species transmissions. We found that the recent, but not the ancient, evolution of astroviruses was associated with a switch in nucleotide composition and codon usage among non-human mammalian versus human/avian astroviruses. Virus and hosts phylogenies based on codon usage agreed with each other and matched the hosts\u0027 evolutionary emergence order. This recent switch in driving forces acting at the synonymous level points to the adaptation of codon usage by viruses to that of their hosts after cross-species transmissions. This is the first demonstration of nucleotide composition and codon usage being active driving forces during the recent evolutionary history of a virus group in the host-parasite system.",
