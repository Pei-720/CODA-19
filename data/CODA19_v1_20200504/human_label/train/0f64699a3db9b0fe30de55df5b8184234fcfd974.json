      "original_text": "The 5 and 3 untranslated regions (UTRs) of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) RNA form highly ordered secondary structures that have been confirmed to play important regulatory roles in viral cap-independent internal translation initiation and RNA replication. We previously demonstrated that deletions in different regions of the 5 UTR significantly reduced viral RNA translation and infectivity. Such observations suggested strongly that viral RNA translation and replication could be blocked if highly specific antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (AS-ODNs) were applied to target crucial sites within the 5 and 3 UTRs. In this study, seven phosphorothioate AS-ODNs were synthesized, and the antiviral activity was evaluated by Lipofectin transfection of HeLa cells with AS-ODNs followed by infection of CVB3. Analysis by Western blotting, reverse transcription-PCR, and viral plaque assay demonstrated that viral protein synthesis, genome replication, and infectivity of CVB3 were strongly inhibited by the AS-ODNs complementary to different regions of the 5 and 3 UTRs. The most effective sites are located at the proximate terminus of the 5 UTR (AS-1), the proximate terminus of the 3 UTR (AS-7), the core sequence of the internal ribosome entry site (AS-2), and the translation initiation codon region (AS-4). These AS-ODNs showed highly sequence-specific and dose-dependent inhibitory effects on both viral protein synthesis and RNA replication. It is noteworthy that the highest inhibitory activities were obtained with AS-1 and AS-7 targeting the termini of the 5 and 3 UTRs. The percent inhibition values of AS-1 and AS-7 for CVB3 protein VP1 synthesis and RNA replication were 70.6 and 79.6 for AS-1 and 73.7 and 79.7 for AS-7, respectively. These data suggest that CVB3 infectivity can be inhibited effectively by AS-ODNs.",
