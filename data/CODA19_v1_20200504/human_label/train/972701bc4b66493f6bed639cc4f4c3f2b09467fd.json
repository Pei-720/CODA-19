Owing to its antibody spectrum, this egg powder was very suitable for this farm since mainly rotavirus was identified. Regardless of the dosage (2 g, 4 g, or 8 g egg powder), the calves (n \u003d 164) which received specific egg-yolk antibodies via the whole egg during the first 14 days of life showed significant improvements in risk and duration of diarrhea and in body weight gain compared with calves of the control group (n \u003d 80) which had not received any egg powder. These significant differences in body weight still persisted after 3 months of life. The mortality risk in the control group amounted to 8.8%, while in all egg powder groups (n \u003d 164) only one calf died as a result of diarrhea. Breed-dependent differences in the parameters were not observed.",
