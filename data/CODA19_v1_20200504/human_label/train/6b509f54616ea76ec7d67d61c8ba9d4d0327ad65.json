Localization of resident marker proteins has shown that this compartment consists of both peripheral and central elements . The aim of the present review is to combine the data on the pre-Golgi compartment with previous ideas of membrane traffic at the ER-Golgi interface . We propose a model which describes how mobile, endosome-like elements of the pre-Golgi compartment function in the generation of the compositional andfunctional boundary between the widely distributed ER and the more central4 located Golgi stacks .",
