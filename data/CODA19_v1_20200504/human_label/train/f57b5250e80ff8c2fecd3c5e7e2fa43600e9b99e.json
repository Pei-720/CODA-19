      "original_text": "People in the Middle East have been affected by the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus (MERS Co-V) since 2012. New cases are continuously reported especially in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the risk of exposure remains an issue. Data visualization plays a vital role in effective analysis of the data. In this paper, we introduce an interactive visualization application for MERS data collected from the Control and Command Centre, Ministry of Health website of Saudi Arabia. The data corresponding to the period from January 1, 2019 to February 28, 2019 was used in the present work. The attributes considered include gender, age, date of reporting, city, region, camel contact, description and status of the patient. The visualization tool has been developed using Shiny framework of R programming language. The application presents information in the form of interactive plots, maps and tables. The salient feature of the tool is that users can view and download data corresponding to the period of their choice. This tool can help decision makers in the detailed analysis of data and hence devise measures to prevent the spread of the disease.",
