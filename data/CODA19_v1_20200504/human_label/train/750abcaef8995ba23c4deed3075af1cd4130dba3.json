Four major protein species were resolved by electrophoresis and many of their properties were deduced from digestion studies using proteolytic enzymes. The four proteins are: (1) A 190 kDa protein, the presumed peplomeric protein, that was glycosylated and proteolytically cleavable by trypsin into subunits of 110 and 90 kDa. The subunits each represent a different amino acid sequence on the basis of peptide mapping;",
