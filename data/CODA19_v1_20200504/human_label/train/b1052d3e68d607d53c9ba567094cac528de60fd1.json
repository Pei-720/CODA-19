      "original_text": "Aim: To investigate the prevalence of urinary tract infections in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and identify corresponding risk factors. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study on 7.347 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus as the principal diagnosis, using hospitalization discharge summary data from January 1 to December 31, 2015. Disease stages were classified as stages 1, 2, and 3. Results: Of 7.347 patients, 16.2% had urinary tract infections. The urinary tract infection prevalence was 24.4% in 428 patients in stage 1 and 4.8% in 2.840 patients in stage 2; it was higher among patients who underwent medical procedures than among those who underwent surgery (24.4% vs 4.8%). In multivariate regression analysis, age (OR \u003d 1.031; 95% CI \u003d 1.02-1.04), length of hospitalization (OR \u003d 1.018; 95% CI \u003d 1.013-1.024), sex (woman) (OR \u003d 2.248; 95% CI \u003d 1.778-2.842), comorbidity of stage 3 cerebrovascular disease (OR \u003d 1.737; 95% CI \u003d 1.111-2.714), and comorbidity of stage 1 colorectal cancer (OR \u003d 2.417; 95% CI \u003d 1.152-5.074) were found to be the risk factors of urinary tract infection in the ten hospitals considered. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that urinary tract infection prevalence was higher in women without evidence of organ injury and those receiving medical treatment. Comorbidities (cerebrovascular disease and colorectal cancer) were identified as risk factors.",
