An empirical analysis was applied to inbound tourists to Taiwan. The results shed light on diversification in tourism market and offer tourism authorities and policy-makers explicit guidelines for risk management in the destination planning process. Specifically, using optimal mixes with various return/risk options can facilitate a more stable pattern of arrivals from foreign countries. To achieve the Doubling Tourist Arrivals Plan, introduced by the Taiwanese government in 2002, the tourism authorities should take the high-return/ high-risk option and shift available resources to Japan. More policy implications are provided to guide tourism authorities and policy makers. r",
