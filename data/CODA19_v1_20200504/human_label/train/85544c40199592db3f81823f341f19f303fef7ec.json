Nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum were collected from 30 sentinel hospitals in Beijing and subjected to EV and EV-D68 detection by real-time PCR. The VP1 gene region and complete genome sequences of EV-D68 positive cases were analyzed. Of 21816 ARTI cases, 619 (2.84%) were EV positive and 42 cases were EV-D68 positive. The detection rates of EV-D68 were 0 (0/6644) in 2015, 0.53% (40/7522) in 2016 and 0.03% (2/7650) in 2017, respectively. Two peaks of EV-D68 infections occurred in late summer and early-winter. Ten cases (23.81%) with upper respiratory tract infection and 32 cases (76.19%) presented with pneumonia, including 3 cases with severe pneumonia. The phylogenetic analysis suggested 15 subclade D3 strains and 27 subclade B3 strains of EV-D68 were circulated in China from 2016 to 2017. A total of 52 amino acid polymorphisms were identified between subclades D1 and D3. These data suggest an upsurge of EV-D68 occurred in Beijing in 2016, the new subclade D3 emerged in 2016 and co-circulated with subclade B3 between 2016 and 2017.",

No statistically significant difference of EV-D68 positive rates was identified in the different age groups in 2016 (P \u003d 0.062). Statistical analysis. The differences of EV-D68 positive cases among different age groups were performed using chi-square test. The comparison of EV-D68 different subclades proportions in different age groups were performed using fisher\u0027s exact test. The comparison of respiratory diseases by different subclades of EV-D68 were performed using fisher\u0027s exact test. A two-sided P value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. All analyses were performed using SPSS software, version 17.0.",
