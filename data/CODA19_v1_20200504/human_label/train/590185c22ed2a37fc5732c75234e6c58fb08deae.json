It was found that simultaneous application of these heterogeneous and homogeneous AOPs (UV/TiO 2 /H 2 O 2 or S 2 O 8 2− ) is not desirable due to some physico-chemical retarding effects. The influence of temperature on the reactions was examined in the range of 15-45 • C and a kinetic power law model jointed with the Arrhenius equation was introduced. A pseudo first order reaction rate is appropriate for UV/S 2 O 8 2− and UV/TiO 2 processes under optimum conditions, while this order for UV/H 2 O 2 process is 2.27. Meanwhile, the initial rates of degradation in UV/TiO 2 process can be described well by the Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model. Analysis of energy consumptions (thermal and electrical) revealed that increasing in temperature is an effective factor for lowering the energy cost of the preferred process of UV/S 2 O 8 2− .",
