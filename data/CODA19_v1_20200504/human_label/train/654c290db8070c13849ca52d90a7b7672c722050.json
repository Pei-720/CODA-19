      "original_text": "IFNb innate immune plays an essential role in antiviral immune. Previous reports suggested that many important regulatory proteins in innate immune pathway may be modified by ubiquitin and that many de-ubiquitination (DUB) proteins may affect immunity. Monocyte chemotactic protein-inducing protein 1 (MCPIP1), one of the CCCH Zn finger-containing proteins, was reported to have DUB function, but its effect on IFNb innate immune was not fully understood. In this study, we uncovered a novel mechanism that may explain how MCPIP1 efficiently inhibits IFNb innate immune. It was found that MCPIP1 negatively regulates the IFNb expression activated by RIG-I, STING, TBK1, IRF3. Furthermore, MCPIP1 inhibits the nuclear translocation of IRF3 upon stimulation with virus, which plays a key role in type I IFN expression. Additionally, MCPIP1 interacts with important modulators of IFNb expression pathway including IPS1, TRAF3, TBK1 and IKKε. Meanwhile, the interaction between the components in TRAF3-TBK1-IKKε complex was disrupted by MCPIP1. These results collectively suggest MCPIP1 as an innate immune regulator encoded by the host and point to a new mechanism through which MCPIP1 negatively regulates IRF3 activation and type I IFNb expression.",
