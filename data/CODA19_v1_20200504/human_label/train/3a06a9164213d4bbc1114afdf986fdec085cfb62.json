A library of flavonols has been made through Algar-Flynn-Oyamada reaction from 2 0 -hydroxyacetophenones and benzaldehydes. Glycosylation of these flavonols with various glycosyl donors affords a library of glycosylated flavonols. These compounds are potentially useful pharmacologically active compounds and will be studied for biological activities.",
