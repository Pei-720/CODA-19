Human astroviruses (HAstVs) are a group of non-enveloped, 49 single-stranded, and positive-sense RNA viruses in the family Astroviridae. 50 HAstVs are causative agents of viral diarrhea in young children, 51 immunocompromised patients, and elderly individuals (1-5). The astrovirus 52 genome has three open reading frames (ORFs); ORF1a and ORF1b encode two 53 nonstructural polyproteins (nsPs), and ORF2 encodes the capsid protein (6). The 54 nsP1a polyprotein, transcribed from ORF1a, is involved in viral transcription 55 and replication. When HAstV infects a host cell, nsP1a is cleaved into at least 56 four products, named nsP1a/1, nsP1a/2, nsP1a/3 (protease), and nsP1a/4. The 57 nsP1a/4 protein is located at the C-terminal end of nsP1a.Several domains have 58 been identified in nsP1a/4, including two coiled-coil regions, a death domain 59 (DD), a nuclear localization signal (NLS), a putative viral genome-linked 60 protein(VPg), and a hypervariable region (HVR)(7-12). It was confirmed that 61 nsP1a/4 plays important roles in the activation of capsid maturation and the 62 regulation of RNA replication (13, 14). To better understand the roles of nsP1a 63 and nsP1a/4 in HAstV infection and replication, we characterized host proteins 64",
