As with many of the other organ systems, the respiratory system undergoes several adaptations during pregnancy. Tidal volume increases although the respiratory rate remains unchanged which results in an increase in minute ventilation that up to 50% higher than in nonpregnant women [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Minute oxygen uptake also increases, and allows for the increasing oxygen requirements as the pregnancy advances. There is no change in forced vital capacity, lung compliance, or diffusing capacity; however, functional residual capacity decreases by 15% to 20% at term. Total pulmonary resistance also decreases during pregnancy, possibly because of an increase in progesterone levels. Although overall hemoglobin amount increases and allows for an increase in total oxygencarrying capacity, the increase in blood volume-which is disproportionate to the increase in hemoglobin concentration-results in a physiologic anemia that 0889-8561/06/$ -see front matter D",
