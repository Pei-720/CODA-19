Using the travel history and symptom onset of 88 confirmed cases that were detected outside Wuhan, we estimate the mean incubation period to be 6.4 (5.6 -7.7, 95% CI) days, ranging from 2.1 to 11.1 days (2.5 th to 97.5 th percentile). These values help to inform case definitions for 2019-nCoV and appropriate durations for quarantine.",
