      "original_text": "A study was made of the effects of rotavirus and/or enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) on dairy calves born and suckled on the farm and subsequently reared in isolation. Calves were orally inoculated at 6 days old with either rotavirus (5), ETEC (7), rotavirus and ETEC (5) or remained uninoculated controls (4), and their reactions were recorded by clinical, microbiological, and pathological observations. Rotavirus infection consistently produced diarrhoea, while ETEC inoculated alone did not colonise the intestine. In dual infections, both rotavirus and ETEC multiplied, although the severity of diarrhoea was not greater than that caused by rotavirus alone. Some ETEC-inoculated calves developed subsequent naturally-acquired rotavirus infections, but in these no ETEC multiplication occurred. The results suggest that prior or simultaneous rotavirus infection is necessary to enable ETEC colonisation of the intestine in conventional calves of this age.",
