Alkaloid 7 proved superior to acyclovir, the current standard for herpes simplex virus, type 1 (HSV-1) infection. Compound 7 potently inhibited lytic HSV-1 infection, significantly reduced HSV-1 reactivation, and more potently inhibited varicella zoster virus (VZV) lytic infection. A configurationally defined (3R)-secondary alcohol at C3 proved crucial for efficacious inhibition of lytic HSV-1 infection. Figure 1 . Structure of antiviral Amaryllidaceae alkaloids. Alkaloids 1−7 are natural products. Compounds 7−10 were accessed via total synthesis.
