      "original_text": "Implementing national to community-based \"One Health\" strategy for human, animal and environmental challenges and migrating-led consequences offer great opportunities, and its value of sustained development and wellbeing is an imperative. \"One Health\" strategy in policy commitment, partnership and financial investment are much needed in advocacy, contextual health human-animal and environmental development. Therefore, appropriate and evidence-based handling and management strategies in moving forward universal health coverage and sustainable development goals (SDGs) are essential components to the China-Africa health development initiatives. It is necessary to understand how to strengthen robust and sustainable \"One Health\" approach implementation in national and regional public health and disaster risk reduction programs. Understanding the foundation of \"One Health\" strategy in China-Africa public health cooperation is crucial in fostering health systems preparedness and smart response against emerging and re-emerging threats and epidemics. Building the value of China-Africa \"One Health\" strategy partnerships, frameworks and capacity development and implementation through leveraging on current and innovative China-Africa health initiatives, but also, mobilizing efforts on climatic changes and disasters mitigation and lifestyle adaptations strategies against emerging and current infectious diseases threats are essential to establish epidemic surveillance-response system under the concept of global collaborative coordination and lasting financing mechanisms.
