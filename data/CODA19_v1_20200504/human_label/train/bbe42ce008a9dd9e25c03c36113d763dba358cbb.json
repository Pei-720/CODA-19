      "original_text": "Eukaryotic positive-strand RNA [(+)RNA] viruses are intracellular obligate parasites replicate using the membrane-bound replicase complexes that contain multiple viral and host components. To replicate, (+)RNA viruses exploit host resources and modify host metabolism and membrane organization. Phospholipase D (PLD) is a phosphatidylcholine-and phosphatidylethanolamine-hydrolyzing enzyme that catalyzes the production of phosphatidic acid (PA), a lipid second messenger that modulates diverse intracellular signaling in various organisms. PA is normally present in small amounts (less than 1% of total phospholipids), but rapidly and transiently accumulates in lipid bilayers in response to different environmental cues such as biotic and abiotic stresses in plants. However, the precise functions of PLD and PA remain unknown. Here, we report the roles of PLD and PA in genomic RNA replication of a plant (+)RNA virus, Red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV). We found that RCNMV RNA replication complexes formed in Nicotiana benthamiana contained PLDα and PLDβ. Gene-silencing and pharmacological inhibition approaches showed that PLDs and PLDs-derived PA are required for viral RNA replication. Consistent with this, exogenous application of PA enhanced viral RNA replication in plant cells and plant-derived cellfree extracts. We also found that a viral auxiliary replication protein bound to PA in vitro, and that the amount of PA increased in RCNMV-infected plant leaves. Together, our findings suggest that RCNMV hijacks host PA-producing enzymes to replicate.",

      "original_text": "Red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV) is a (+)RNA plant virus and a member of the genus Dianthovirus in the family Tombusviridae. The genome of RCNMV consists of RNA1 and RNA2. RNA1 encodes a p27 auxiliary replication protein, p88 pol RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and a coat protein [10]. RNA2 encodes a movement protein that is required for viral cell-to-cell movement [10, 11] . p27, p88 pol , and host proteins form a 480-kDa replicase complex, which is a key player in the viral RNA replication [12] . p27 and p88 pol colocalize at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [13, 14] , where RCNMV replication takes place [15] . Our previous studies showed that RCNMV uses host heat shock proteins (HSPs), HSP70 and HSP90 [16], and ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1) [15] for the formation of the 480-kDa replicase complex and p27-induced ER membrane alterations. Arf1 is a small GTPase that regulates COPI vesicle formation. Sar1, another small GTPase that regulates COPII vesicle-mediated trafficking, and Arf1 are recruited from their original subcellular locations to RCNMV replication sites via p27, and p27 interferes with host membrane trafficking pathway in plant cells [15, 17] . Mammalian and yeast Arf1 recruits and/or stimulates its effector proteins, including a coatomer, phosphatidylinositol 4 kinase III β (PI4KIIIβ), and phospholipase D (PLD) [18] . Arf1 can activate mammalian PLD1 and PLD2 directly. PLD hydrolyses structural phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to produce phosphatidic acid (PA) and remaining headgroups. PA production resulting from Arf1-mediated PLD activation has been proposed to be associated with vesicle formation [19] .",
