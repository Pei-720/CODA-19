Models 36 that can assess which individuals are most at risk of being exposed to a pathogen not only 37 provide valuable insights into disease transmission and dynamics but can also guide 38 management interventions. Constructing such models for wild animal populations, 39 however, is particularly challenging; often only serological data is available on a subset 40 of individuals and non-linear relationships between variables are common. 41 42 2. Here we take advantage of the latest advances in statistical machine learning to construct 43 pathogen-risk models that automatically incorporate complex non-linear relationships 44 with minimal statistical assumptions from ecological data with missing values. Our 45 approach compares multiple machine learning algorithms in a unified environment to 46 find the model with the best predictive performance and uses game theory to better 47 interpret results. We apply this framework on two major pathogens that infect African 48 lions: canine distemper virus (CDV) and feline parvovirus.",
