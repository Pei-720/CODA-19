      "original_text": "Purpose: Chest radiography is often performed on patients hospitalized with typical clinical manife stations of bronchiolitis. We aimed to determine the proportion of subjects with pathologic chest radio graphic findings and the clinical predictors associated with pathologic chest radiographic findings in young children admitted with the typical presentation of bronchiolitis. Methods: We obtained the following data at admission: sex, age, neonatal history, past history of hospitalization for respiratory illnesses, heart rate, respiratory rate, the presence of fever, total duration of fever, oxygen saturation, laboratory parameters (i.e., complete blood cell count, highsensitivity Creactive protein [hsCRP], etc.), and chest radiography. Results: The study comprised 279 young children. Of these, 26 had a chest radiograph revealing opacity (n\u003d24) or atelectasis (n\u003d2). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that after adjustment for confounding factors, the clinical predictors associated with pathologic chest radiographic findings in young children admitted with bronchiolitis were elevated hsCRP level (\u003e0.3 mg/dL) and past history of hospitalization for respiratory illnesses (all P\u003c0.05). Conclusion: The current study suggests that chest radiographs in young children with typical clinical manifestations of bronchiolitis have limited value. Nonetheless, young children with clinical factors such as high hsCRP levels at admission or past history of hospitalization for respiratory illnesses may be more likely to have pathologic chest radiographic findings.",
