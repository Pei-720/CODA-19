      "original_text": "Recently it has been reported that a cathepsin B inhibitor, CA-074Me, attenuates ecotropic murine leukemia virus (Eco-MLV) infection in NIH3T3 cells, suggesting that cathepsin B is required for the Eco-MLV infection. However, cathepsin B activity was negative or extremely low in NIH3T3 cells. How did CA-074Me attenuate the Eco-MLV infection? The CA-074Me treatment of NIH3T3 cells inhibited cathepsin L activity, and a cathepsin L specific inhibitor, CLIK148, attenuated the Eco-MLV vector infection. These results indicate that the suppression of cathepsin L activity by CA-074Me induces the inhibition of Eco-MLV infection, suggesting that cathepsin L is required for the Eco-MLV infection in NIH3T3 cells. The CA-074Me treatment inhibited the Eco-MLV infection in human cells expressing the exogenous mouse ecotropic receptor and endogenous cathepsins B and L, but the CLIK148 treatment did not, showing that only the cathepsin L suppression by CLIK148 is not enough to prevent the Eco-MLV infection in cells expressing both of cathepsins B and L, and CA-074Me inhibits the Eco-MLV infection by suppressing both of cathepsins B and L. These results suggest that either cathepsin B or L is sufficient for the Eco-MLV infection.",
