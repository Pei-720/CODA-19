      "original_text": "To examine the effect of provision of information about the infection control in the specific infection disease treatment unit in a city hospital on the outpatient\u0027s intention of outpatient service use, respondents who underwent outpatient medical care at the hospital (N \u003d 821) were asked whether or not they intended to continue the outpatient visit at the hospital if a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patient was admitted to the unit. Although 56% of respondents replied that they could continue to visit the department if a SARS patient was admitted to the unit in the hospital before they read the information, the proportion of those who intended to continue outpatient care significantly increased by 15% after they read it. The logistic regression analyses revealed that respondents who had frequently visited the outpatient department (P \u003c 0.001), those who felt relieved by reading the information about the unit (P \u003c 0.001), and those who did not worry about nosocomial SARS infection inside the hospital (P \u003c 0.001) were significantly more likely to reply that they would continue outpatient visits. We estimated that admission of a SARS patient to the unit would result in a 20% decrease in the cumulative total number of outpatients in the hospital during a 180-day interval after admission of a SARS patient to the unit, and the cumulative total number of outpatients increased by 7% after they read the information. This study suggests that providing outpatients with appropriate information about SARS infection control in the hospital had a statistically significant and substantial impact on the outpatients\u0027 intention to continue outpatient visits at the hospital.",
