PBL influenced both the way the curriculum was developed and the process by which students (n \u003d 18) investigated topics related to the integration of ICT in business studies classrooms. The evaluation was based on five evaluative questions dealing with the implementation of PBL, the extent to which PBL facilitated academic discourse, the extent of ÔnewÕ knowledge about ICT that had been created, the role of the tutor, and the online learning environment provided. The evaluation revealed that PBL provided a practical approach to investigating ICT in both face-to-face and online learning environments, leading to ÔnewÕ knowledge about challenges associated with the adoption and use of new technologies in various educational settings.",
