      "original_text": "RSV has two subtypes, A and B, with the former typically causing more severe disease. While both subtypes can simultaneously circulate during outbreaks, a few distinct genotypes of each subtype can predominate within a community. The dominant strains can also shift yearly. This shifting of viral strains, along with the waning protective immunity from natural infection, might account for frequent re-infections throughout life [38] . RSV usually causes mild and self-limited URTI in healthy older children and nonelderly adults, but certain patient populations are at risk for developing severe RSV infection, including premature or very young infants, elderly patients with comorbidities, or immunocompromised hosts [39] [40] [41] . RSV has been associated with apnea in young or preterm infants [42] and can cause severe LRTI in children including bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and acute respiratory failure [42] . Among adults infected with RSV, more than 80% are symptomatic, and lower respiratory tract signs and symptoms can occur in a quarter of the patients [43] . Signs of URTI include cough, rhinorrhea, and conjunctivitis, and compared to influenza, RSV is more frequently associated with nasal congestion, ear and sinus involvement, productive cough, and longer duration of illness [43] .",
