      "original_text": "A total of 446 serum samples from 88 herds in Korea were examined for antibody to porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) using blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). All serum samples were collected from 24-to 26-week-old finishing pigs between December 1998 and June 1999. By ELISA, 237 out of 446 sera tested (53.1%) and 54 out of 88 sampled herds (61.3%) were positive against PRCV. Of 446 sera from 88 herd tested, 185 (41.5%) serum samples from 22 (25%) herds were seronegative against PRCV and transmissible gastroenteritis virus infection. Our data suggested that seropositive herds for PRCV are distributed diffusely throughout South Korea. #",
