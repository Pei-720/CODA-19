Serum samples were analysed for antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus. The patient history and symptoms, including Centor score, were analysed in relation to pathogens. In 155/220 (70.5%) of the patients, as compared to 26/128 (20.3%) of the controls (p \u003c0.001), at least one microorganism was found. Group A streptococci, F. necrophorum, and influenza B virus were the three most common findings, and all significantly more common in patients than in controls (p \u003c0.001, p 0.001, and p 0.002, respectively). Patients with F. necrophorum only (n \u003d 14) displayed a lower Centor score than patients with Group A streptococcus only (n \u003d 46), but a higher score than patients with influenza B, other viruses, or no potential pathogen (Kruskal-Wallis p \u003c0.001). A pathogen was detected in 70% of the patients, displaying a wide range of pathogens contributing to the aetiology of pharyngotonsillitis. This study supports F. necrophorum as one of the pathogens to be considered in the aetiology of pharyngotonsillitis.",
