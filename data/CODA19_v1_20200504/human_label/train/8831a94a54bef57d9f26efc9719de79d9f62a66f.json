      "original_text": "Findings: A jet plume of air leaked through the mask exhaust holes to a radial distance of 0.25 m from the mask during the application of IPAP at 10 cm H 2 O with some leakage from the nasal bridge. The leakage plume exposure probability was highest about 60 to 80 mm lateral to the median sagittal plane of the HPS. Without nasal bridge leakage, the jet plume from the exhaust holes increased to a 0.40-m radius from the mask, whereas exposure probability was highest about 0.28 m above the patient. When IPAP was increased to 18 cm H 2 O, the vertical plume extended to 0.45 m above the patient with some horizontal spreading along the ward ceiling. Conclusion: Substantial exposure to exhaled air occurs within a 0.5-m radius of patients receiving NPPV. Medical wards should be designed with an architectural aerodynamics approach and knowledge of air/particle dispersion from common mechanical ventilatory techniques. (CHEST 2006; 130:730 -740) ",
