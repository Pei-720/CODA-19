Environmental triggers that cause a breakdown of myelinspecific T cell tolerance are unknown. We found that CD8 + myelin basic protein (MBP)-specific T cell tolerance can be broken and autoimmunity induced by infection with a virus that does not express MBP cross-reactive epitopes and does not depend on bystander activation. Instead, the virus activated dual T cell receptor (TCR)-expressing T cells capable of recognizing both MBP and viral antigens. These results demonstrate the importance of dual TCR T cells in autoimmunity and suggest a mechanism by which a ubiquitous viral infection could trigger autoimmunity in a subset of infected individuals, as hypothesized in the etiology of MS.",

It is believed to be an autoimmune disease in which exposure of genetically predisposed individuals to environmental factors triggers a breakdown in T cell tolerance to myelin antigens. The specific types of myelin-specific T cells that contribute to the pathogenesis of MS are not known. Most studies have focused on the pathogenic role of myelin-specific CD4 + T cells because of the relatively strong association of MS susceptibility with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II alleles. In addition, CD4 + T cells are the primary effector T cells in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a widely used animal model of MS. However, there has been increasing recognition of the potential importance of CD8 + T cells in the pathogenesis of MS. CD8 + T cells typically outnumber CD4 + T cells in acute and chronic lesions in MS patients, and the CD8 + T cell subset exhibits more evidence of antigen-driven activation compared to CD4 + T cells in the CNS and blood of MS patients1, 2.
