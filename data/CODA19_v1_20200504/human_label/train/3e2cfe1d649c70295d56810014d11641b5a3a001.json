      "original_text": "The vascular endothelium can be considered as an organ/tissue which comprises a monolayer of endothelial cells which serve as a semipermeable cellular barrier separating the inner space of blood vessels from its surrounding tissue and to control the exchange of fluids and cells between the two compartments. Since the pulmonary circulation receives the entire cardiac output, the large surface area of the lung microvasculature is well suited for sensing mechanical, chemical, and cellular injury by inhaled or circulating substances. This endothelial barrier is dynamically regulated through exposure to these various stimuli of physiological and pathological origin and serves to regulate multiple key biological processes (including lung fluid balance and solute transport between vascular compartments). For example, an increase in vascular permeability is a necessary feature of the body\u0027s defense mechanism to provide injured tissues with access to leucocytes, resulting in tissue edema due to fluid extravasation. However, during conditions of intense lung inflammation such as observed in acute lung injury or its severer form of acute respiratory distress syndrome, the large surface area becomes a liability and provides the opportunity for profound vascular permeability resulting in massive fluid accumulation in the alveolar space and progressively leading to pulmonary failure. Alterations in vascular permeability occur not only in acute inflammatory lung disorders primarily caused by sepsis, pneumonia, and trauma which result in high rates of patient morbidity and mortality, but are an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in subacute lung inflammatory disorders such as ischemia-reperfusion injury, radiation lung injury, and asthma. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of endothelial barrier dysfunction is vital for the management and treatment of key and enigmatic pulmonary disorders.",
