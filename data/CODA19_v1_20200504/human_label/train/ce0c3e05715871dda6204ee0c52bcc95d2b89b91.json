Fever (77.6%%), cough (43.6%) and weakness (14.7%) were the common symptoms. Leukocytes were mainly normal or decreased in 185 patients (92.9%), both lymphocytes and eosinophils were below normal range, the ratios were 56.9% and 50.3%, respectively. On the contrary, lactate dehydrogenases raised in 65 patients. C-reactive protein (72.4%) elevated in the most of patients. The sensitivity of RT-PCR was 63.5%. Chest CT indicated that bilateral patchy shadows (69.0%) were the most common imaging manifestations.169(85.8%) patients recovered and transferred to a designated hospital for observation, and the others (14.2%) turned worst and died of acute respiratory failure. Conclusion COVID-19 infection with highly contagious have become a life-threaten public healthy problem, the sensitivity of RT-PCR was limited.",
