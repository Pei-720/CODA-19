Passive immunization with neutralizing antibodies against PEDV is an effective prevention measure. In this study, single chain fragment variable (scFv) antibodies against PEDV were screened from the porcine scFv phage display library. After four rounds of biopanning, scFvs that showed higher affinity to the PEDV antigen were selected for further study. The scFv genes were cloned into the expression plasmid for recombinant protein expression. These scFvs were shown to inhibit PEDV infectivity by the plaque reduction neutralization assay. Immunofluorescence assay (IFA) revealed that the epitopes recognized by these scFvs were in the S1 region of the spike protein. The potential of scFvs to provide prevention against PEDV infections in piglets was further investigated. Piglets orally administered scFvs showed no to mild clinical symptoms, significantly less viral shedding, no mortality and no intestinal lesions. The field application also revealed that the survival rate of piglets was significantly increased by oral administration of scFvs. Our data support the potential role of scFvs in the prevention and treatment of PEDV infection. virulent variants emphasizes the importance of developing an effective method to control their spread and infection.",

The S protein can be cleaved into S1 (residues 1-789) and S2 subunits (residues 790-1386) by host protease [16] . The S1 subunit contains the N-terminal domain (NTD, residues 1-233) that shows sialic acid binding activity and the C-terminal domain (CTD, residues 253-638) that attaches to the cell surface receptor (e.g., aminopeptidase N (APN)) [17]. The S2 subunit mediates virus-cell membrane fusion [16] . S protein is an excellent target for vaccine development for the induction of protective immunity against PEDV. Several studies have confirmed that antibodies, especially neutralizing antibodies stimulated by the vaccine expressing spike protein, are able to protect the host from PEDV infection [18, 19] . Additionally, neutralizing antibodies against PEDV can be developed as candidates for passive protection. Lee et al. reported that egg yolk antibody (IgY) against S1 domain of spike protein efficiently protects neonatal piglets against PEDV, supporting the potential of antibody reagents as a prophylactic or therapeutic agent to protect piglets against PEDV infection [20] .",
