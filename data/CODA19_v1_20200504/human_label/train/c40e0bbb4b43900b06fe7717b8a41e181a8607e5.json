      "original_text": "Enterobacterial pathogens that have acquired antibiotic resistance genes are a leading cause of community and hospital acquired infections. In such a situation vaccination is considered as a better option to prevent such infections. In the current study reverse vaccinology approach has been used to select peptides from already known immunogenic proteins to design a chimeric construct. We selected Yersiniabactin receptor of Escherichia coli UMN026 and Flagellin of Stenotrophomonas maltophila. B-cell linear epitopes were predicted using Bepipred prediction tool. Peptide binding with reference sets of 27 alleles of MHC class I and class II was also analyzed. The predicted peptides-MHC complexes were further validated using simulation dynamics. The insilico construction of chimera was done by restriction mapping and codon optimization. Chimera was evaluated using the immunoinformatic approach as done for the selected proteins. From the 673 amino acids of FyuA protein, a region from 1 to 492 was selected for containing more linear epitopes and the processing scores obtained were significant for MHC class I and class II binding. Similarly, from Flagellin, a region between 60 and 328 amino acids was selected and the peptides present in the selected region showed lower percentile ranks for binding with MHC molecules. The simulation studies validated the predictions of peptide-MHC complexes. The selected gene fragments accommodating maximum part of these peptides were used to design a chimaeric construct of 2454 bp. From the immunoinformatic analysis, the chimera was found to be more immunogenic in terms of increased number of B-cell and T-cell epitopes along with increased coverage of global populations with allelic variability.",
