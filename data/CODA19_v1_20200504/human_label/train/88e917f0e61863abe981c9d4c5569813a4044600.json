The following clinical variables were evaluated: sudden onset, fever, respiratory symptoms, sore throat, malaise and gastrointestinal symptoms. These variables were studied for each virus and for two age groups: age 14 years or younger and older than 14 years. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.",
