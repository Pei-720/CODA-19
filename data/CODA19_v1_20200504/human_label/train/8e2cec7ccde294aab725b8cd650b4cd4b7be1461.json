Moreover, HR1 and HR2 derived free peptides are inhibitors of SARS-CoV entry. In this work we used circular dichroism to show that HR2 helix formation is induced at pH 5, the pH of the endosome. In addition, we demonstrate that the HR2 helix is further stabilized at physiological ionic strengths. Together, these observations provide new insight into the mechanism of SARS-CoV entry and suggest that HR2 may be an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.",
