      "original_text": "Ever since the discovery of SARS-CoV in the year 2003, numerous researchers around the world have been working relentlessly to understand the biology of this virus. As in other coronaviruses, nucleocapsid (N) is one of the most crucial structural components of the SARS-CoV. Hence major attention has been focused on characterization of this protein. Independent studies conducted by several laboratories have elucidated significant insight into the primary function of this protein, which is to encapsidate the viral genome. In addition, many reports also suggest that this protein interferes with different cellular pathways, thus implying it to be a key regulatory component of the virus too. In the first part of this review, we will discuss these different properties of the N-protein in a consolidated manner. Further, this protein has also been proposed to be an efficient diagnostic tool and a candidate vaccine against the SARS-CoV. Hence, towards the end of this article, we will discuss some recent progress regarding the possible clinically relevant use of the N-protein. #",
