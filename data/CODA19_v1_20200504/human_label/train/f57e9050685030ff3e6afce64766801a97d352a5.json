His posttransplant course was complicated by graft versus host disease and multiple central venous catheter infections with coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp., vancomycinresistant Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, and alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus. During his initial course, he also developed a nodular pneumonia, and the subsequent workup included a bronchoscopy that was nondiagnostic. The pneumonia resolved with empiric posaconazole treatment. Sixteen months after the transplant, the patient developed fatigue, low-grade fevers, and cough. Chest x-ray (CXR) showed a new, left lower lobe infiltrate. A sputum culture then grew fluoroquinolone-susceptible Pseudomonas, and the Oncology Service subsequently discharged the patient home on moxifloxacin alone. Three weeks later, he presented again with recurrent cough and fever and was readmitted. A CXR showed a new, right lower lobe infiltrate.",
