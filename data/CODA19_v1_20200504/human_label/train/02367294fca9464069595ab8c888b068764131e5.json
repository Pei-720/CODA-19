This technology has been developed into commercially available detection kits for a variety of pathogens including bacteria and viruses. The current focus on LAMP methodology is as a diagnostic system to be employed in resource-limited laboratories in developing countries, where many fatal tropical diseases are endemic. The combination of LAMP and novel microfl uidic technologies such as Lab-on-a-chip may facilitate the realization of genetic point-of-care testing systems to be used by both developed and developing countries in the near future. This review will describe the historical, current, and future developments of such technologies.",
