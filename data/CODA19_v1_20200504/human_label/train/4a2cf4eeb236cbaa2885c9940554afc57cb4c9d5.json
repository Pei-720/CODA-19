Data Synthesis: Out of 1675 non-duplicate studies identified, 57 were included. Pooled mean 41 incubation period was 5.84 (99% CI: 4.83, 6.85) days. Pooled mean number of days from the 42 onset of COVID-19 symptoms to first clinical visit was 4.82 (95% CI: 3.48, 6.15), ICU admission 43 was 10.48 (95% CI: 9.80, 11.16), recovery was 17.76 (95% CI: 12.64, 22.87), and until death 44 was 15.93 (95% CI: 13.07, 18.79). Pooled probability of COVID-19-related death was 0.02 (95% 45 CI: 0.02, 0.03). 46",
