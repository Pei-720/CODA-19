      "original_text": "Antisense oligonucleotides and short interfering RNAs (siR-NAs) are nucleic acids-targeting reagents for gene expression modulation that are being developed as drugs for many applications. A number of useful synthetic nucleic acids analogues have been introduced recently to greatly improve their properties for use as therapeutics. However, their full effectiveness in cells and in vivo has often only been realized through development of suitable nonviral delivery systems. Among these, a range of natural and synthetic peptides have been found useful for enhancing cellular uptake and/or cell targeting of oligonucleotide analogues and siRNA. Such peptides are synthetically conjugated, used as noncovalent complexes, or used in combination with polymer, liposomal or exosome formulation techniques. This review begins by describing the modes of action of antisense reagents and siRNA and goes on to focus on recent advances in their peptide-mediated cell and in vivo delivery and how peptide use has influenced drug development. The review discusses the challenges associated with understanding the physiological and toxicological aspects of peptide-mediated delivery. Developments towards clinical use are also highlighted, with particular emphasis on peptide conjugates of oligonucleotide analogues used for treatment of neuromuscular diseases.",
