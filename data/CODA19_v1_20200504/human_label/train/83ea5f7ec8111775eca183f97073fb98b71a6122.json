Cytostatic activity evaluation of the novel compounds showed that E-isomers exhibited, in general, better cytostatic activities than the corresponding Z-isomers. E-isomer 14 exhibited the best cytostatic effect against all evaluated malignant cell lines, particularly against hepatocellular carcinoma (Hep G2, IC 50 \u003d 4.3 lM). However, this compound was also cytotoxic to human normal fibroblasts (WI 38). Its Z-isomer 7 showed highly specific antiproliferative activity against Hep G2 (IC 50 \u003d 18 lM) and no cytotoxicity to WI 38. Moreover, compounds 3, 4 and 14 expressed some marginal inhibitory activity against HIV-1 and HIV-2.",
