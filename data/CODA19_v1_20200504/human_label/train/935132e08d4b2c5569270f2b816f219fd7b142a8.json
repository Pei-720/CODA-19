      "original_text": "The envelope spike (S) glycoprotein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) mediates the entry of the virus into target cells. Recent studies point out to a cell entry mechanism of this virus similar to other enveloped viruses, such as HIV-1. As it happens with other viruses peptidic fusion inhibitors, SARS-CoV S protein HR2-derived peptides are potential therapeutic drugs against the virus. It is believed that HR2 peptides block the six-helix bundle formation, a key structure in the viral fusion, by interacting with the HR1 region. It is a matter of discussion if the HIV-1 gp41 HR2-derived peptide T20 (enfuvirtide) could be a possible SARS-CoV inhibitor given the similarities between the two viruses. We tested the possibility of interaction between both T20 (HIV-1 gp41 HR2-derived peptide) and T-1249 with S protein HR1-and HR2-derived peptides. Our biophysical data show a significant interaction between a SARS-CoV HR1-derived peptide and T20. However, the interaction is only moderate (K B \u003d (1.1 T 0.3) Â 10 5 M À1 ). This finding shows that the reasoning behind the hypothesis that T20, already approved for clinical application in AIDS treatment, could inhibit the fusion of SARS-CoV with target cells is correct but the effect may not be strong enough for application.
