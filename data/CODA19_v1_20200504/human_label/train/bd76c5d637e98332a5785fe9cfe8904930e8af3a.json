      "original_text": "Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against herpes simplex virus (HSV)-coded glycoproteins gB, gC, gD and gE were employed in an in vitro model of neuroinvasiveness using sensory neurons from rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells . The neurons were cultured in a two-chamber system allowing infection via the neuritic extensions exclusively . The effects of 30 MAbs on viral replication of the encephalitis-derived HSV-1 strain 2762 and its less neuroinvasive variant 2762p11 were assayed in this model . One MAb reactive with gD gave a nine-fold reduction of the virus yields of both strains . One MAb directed against gB gave an enhanced virus yield of strain 2762, but not of the 2762p11 variant . Another gB-reactive MAb decreased the virus yield of strain 2762pll, but not of 2762 after neuritic infection . The findings indicate that an alteration of gB has occurred during the passage of the strain 2762 . Mutants of the same strain were derived by infecting hybridomas producing MAb reactive with gB, gC, gD and gE, respectively . The gB hybridoma mutant showed a significantly lower neuroinvasiveness in the DRG model, and was non-virulent after snout infection of mice . We suggest that the structure of gB of the strain 2762 is of importance for the neuroinvasiveness of this strain .",
