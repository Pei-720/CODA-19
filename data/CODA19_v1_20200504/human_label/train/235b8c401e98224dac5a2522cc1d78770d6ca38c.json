      "original_text": "Newborn Holstein (n \u003d 48) and Jersey (n \u003d 30) calves were studied to compare absorption of immunoglobulin G (IgG) from maternal colostrum (n \u003d 39) or colostrum replacement containing an Ig concentrate derived from bovine serum (n \u003d 39). Calves were also fed milk replacer with (n \u003d 38) or without (n \u003d 40) animal plasma (20% of crude protein) to 29 d of age to determine effect of plasma protein on IgG status, health, and growth. Calves were fed maternal colostrum or colostrum replacement at 1.5 and 13.5 h of age and provided a total of 250 or 249 and 180 or 186 g of IgG for Holsteins and Jerseys fed maternal colostrum or colostrum replacement, respectively. Milk replacer (12.5% DM) was fed at 31% of metabolic birth weight (2 feedings/d). Plasma was sampled at 0 h, 24 h, and weekly to determine IgG by turbidimetric immunoassay. At blood collection, calves were weighed and measured to determine growth. Health scores, fecal scores, and grain intake were measured daily. Plasma IgG at 24 h did not differ between calves fed maternal colostrum (13.78 ± 0.39 g/ L) and colostrum replacement (13.96 ± 0.38 g/L). Average daily gain, withers height, hip height, body length, heart girth, health, and incidence of diarrhea were not different between treatment groups. Calves fed maternal colostrum used feed more efficiently than calves fed colostrum replacement. Plasma IgG and performance were not affected by the addition of animal plasma to milk replacer. The colostrum replacement used in this study provided adequate IgG for newborn calves. Animal plasma was an acceptable source of protein but did not enhance growth or immunity under the conditions of this study.
