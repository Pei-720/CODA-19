Amer J Epid 94: 43-49, 1971.-Acute and convalescent serum pairs and control sera collected from subjects living in a children\u0027s home over a 7-year period (1960)(1961)(1962)(1963)(1964)(1965)(1966)(1967) were examined by hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test witl coronavirus strain OC 43. Ninety-three serologic conversions were observed; 44 were associated with reported illnesses and 49 with no reported illnesses. In three distinct outbreaks during the winter and spring quarter of 1960-1961, 1964-1965, and 1966-1967, 67 conversions occurred. Seroconversions to strain OC 43 were associated with as much as 19% of the respiratory diseases in a single season. Over the 7-year period coronavirus strain OC 43 accounted for 3% of the total 1328 respiratory illnesses. Evidence of preexisting antibody was apparent in one-third of the children showing seroconversions. The j^ ( HI test was more sensitive for serodiagnosis than the complement-fixaticn test. The major presenting complaints of the children with respiratory disease associated with coronavirus strain OC 43 were sore throat, cough and coryza; the predominating symptoms were pharyngitis, coryza, fever and cervical adenitis.",
