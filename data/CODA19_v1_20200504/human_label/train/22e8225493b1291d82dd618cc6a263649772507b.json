      "original_text": "Given the increasing volatility in the economic performance of airlines, partially reflecting the dynamics of demand for air transport and the fixed costs associated with the industry, all stakeholders need to consider appropriate strategies for better managing the risks. Many risks were identified in the literature previously, some even decades ago, however most have yet to be satisfactorily addressed. Urgency is growing. Removal of the remaining barriers to competition at all levels, congestion management, open skies policies across continents, computer-centric air traffic management systems and increased research and development into the processes and technology needed to reduce environmental externalities remain among the top challenges for the next decade.",
