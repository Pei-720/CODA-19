Eight different cut-off values were used to define a positive S-Hp analysis result: \u003e0.05, \u003e0.06, \u003e0.07, \u003e0.08, \u003e0.09, \u003e0.10, \u003e0.15 and \u003e0.20 g/L. A rectal temperature \u003e39.5°C was denoted as fever. A positive result of five different diagnostic tests for CRD was defined as: (1) a positive S-Hp with fever absent, (2) a positive S-Hp with fever present, (3) either a positive S-Hp or fever, (4) both a positive S-Hp and fever, and (5) fever (regardless of S-Hp). The sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of each test were calculated from regression coefficients of generalized linear mixed models of the binary test results, applying a logit link. Apart from CRD status (within the 14 days before sampling; no or yes), the models included sex (bull or heifer), and for the test based on S-Hp alone, also rectal temperature (fever, no or yes). Confidence intervals (CI) of Se and Sp were estimated by simulation.",
