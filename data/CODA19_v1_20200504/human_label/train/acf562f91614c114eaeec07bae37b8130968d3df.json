In both valleys, the estimated speed of the wave and R 2 declined slightly with the elevation threshold ( figure S2 ). However, all estimated values remained within the 95% CI of the estimation using 3600 meters, the assumed value in our main analysis. Thus, the estimation of the wave speed was largely insensitive to the elevation threshold.
