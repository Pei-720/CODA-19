In an attempt to understand the evolution of PEDV in the United States and possibly develop a control strategy, we compared the genome sequences of a PEDV strain isolated from an infected piglet against its in vitro adapted version. The original PEDV strain was grown in Vero cells and passed 10 times serially in a MARC145 cell line. The sequence analysis of the native PEDV strain and in vitro passaged virus shows that the cell culture adaptation specifically modifies PEDV spike protein whereas the open reading frame 1a/b (ORF1a/b)-encoded polyprotein, the nucleoprotein, NS3B (ORF3), and membrane and envelope proteins remain unchanged.",
