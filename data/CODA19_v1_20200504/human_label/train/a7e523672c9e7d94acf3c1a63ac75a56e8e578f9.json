Most of gene activation due cytokine mediated but which are due to methylation mediated is still unknown. In the study, DNA methylome was integrated with our previous transcriptome data to investigate the differentially methylated regions and genes using MeDIP-chip technology. We found that the transcriptional expressions of 15, 37 and 18 genes were negatively related with their promoter DNA methylation levels in the cells treated by PolyI:C, Aza-CdR, as well as PolyI:C plus Aza-CdR, respectively, compared with the untreated cells. GO analysis revealed hypo-methylated genes (BNIP3L and CDK9) and a hyper-methylated gene (ZC3HAV1) involved in the host response to viral replication. Our results suggest that these novel genes targeted by DNA methylation can be potential markers relevant to virus replication and host innate immune response to set up a medical model of infectious diseases.
