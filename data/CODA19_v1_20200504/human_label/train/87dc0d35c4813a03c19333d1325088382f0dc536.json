      "original_text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease that is characterized by leukocyte infiltration and subsequent axonal damage, demyelinating inflammation, and formation of sclerosing plaques in brain tissue. The results of various studies in patients indicate that autoimmunity and inflammation make an important impact on the pathogenesis of MS. Chemokines are key mediators of inflammation development and cell migration, mediating various immune cell responses, including chemotaxis and immune activation, and are important in immunity and inflammation, therefore we focus on chemokines and their receptors in multiple sclerosis. In this article, we summarize the study of the role of prominent chemokines and their receptors in MS patients and MS animal modelsand discuss their potential significance in inflammatory injury and repair of MS. We have also summarized the progress in the treatment of multiple sclerosis antagonists in recent years with chemokine receptors as targets.",
