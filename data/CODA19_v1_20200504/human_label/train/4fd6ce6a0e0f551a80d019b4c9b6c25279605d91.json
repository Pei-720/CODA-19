EVD was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR assays detecting blood Ebola virus (EBOV). Results: Among the 285 lab-confirmed EVD cases in Jui Government Hospital, 146 recovered and 139 died, with an overall survival rate of 51.23 %. Patients under the age of 6 years had a lower survival rate (37.50 %). Most non-survivors (79.86 %) died within 7 days after admission and the mean hospitalization time for non-survivors was 5.56 ± 6.11 days. More than half survivors (63.69 %) turned blood EBOV negative within 3 weeks after admission and the mean hospitalization time for survivors was 20.38 ± 7.58 days. High blood viral load (≥10 6 copies/ml) was found to be predictive of the non-survival outcome as indicated by the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The probability of patients\u0027 survival was less than 15 % when blood viral load was greater than 10 6 copies/ml. Multivariate analyses showed that blood viral load (P \u003d 0.005), confusion (P \u003d 0.010), abdominal pain (P \u003d 0.003), conjunctivitis (P \u003d 0.035), and vomiting (P \u003d 0.004) were factors independently associated with the outcomes of EVD patients.",
