This host defense is strictly regulated to eliminate the infection while limiting tissue damage that is associated with virus pathogenesis. Post-translational modifications, most notably phosphorylation, are key regulators of the antiviral defense implying an important role of protein phosphatases. Here, we investigated the role of the dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) in the host defense against human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a pathogenic virus of the Pneumoviridae family, and Sendai virus (SeV), a model virus being developed as a vector for anti-RSV vaccine. We found that DUSP1 is upregulated before being subjected to proteasomal degradation. DUSP1 does not inhibit the antiviral response, but negatively regulates virus-induced JNK/p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Interaction with the JNK-interacting protein 1 scaffold protein prevents dephosphorylation of JNK by DUSP1, likely explaining that AP-1 activation and downstream cytokine production are protected from DUSP1 inhibition.",
