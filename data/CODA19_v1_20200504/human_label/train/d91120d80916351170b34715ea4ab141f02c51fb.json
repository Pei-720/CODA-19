      "original_text": "Temperate phage genomes are highly variable mosaic collections of genes that infect a bacterial host, integrate into the host\u0027s genome or replicate as low copy number plasmids, and are regulated to switch from the lysogenic to lytic cycles to generate new virions and escape their host. Genomes from most Bacterial phyla contain at least one or more prophages. We updated our PhiSpy algorithm to improve detection of prophages and to provide a web-based framework for PhiSpy. We have used this algorithm to identify 36,488 prophage regions from 11,941 bacterial genomes, including almost 600 prophages with no known homology to any proteins. Transfer RNA genes were abundant in the prophages, many of which alleviate the limits of translation efficiency due to host codon bias and presumably enable phages to surpass the normal capacity of the hosts\u0027 translation machinery. We identified integrase genes in 15,765 prophages (43% of the prophages). The integrase was routinely located at either end of the integrated phage genome, and was used to orient and align prophage genomes to reveal their underlying organization. The conserved genome alignments of phages recapitulate early, middle, and late gene order in transcriptional control of phage genes, and demonstrate that gene order, presumably selected by transcription timing and/or coordination among functional modules has been stably conserved throughout phage evolution.",
