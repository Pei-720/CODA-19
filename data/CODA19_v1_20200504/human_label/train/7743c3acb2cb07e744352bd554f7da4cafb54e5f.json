Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) with specificities for leukocyte subsets and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens were used to characterize IFNa producer cells. The production of IFNa was found to be a function of non-phagocytic, non-adherent, non-T, non-B, CD4 + (and to a lesser extent CD8 +) MHC-class-II-positive ceils. Furthermore, addition of anti-MHC (class II) mAb during PBMC incubation with virus-infected cells reduced IFN yields, suggesting that masking of these surface antigens alters PBMC responsiveness to IFN induction.",
