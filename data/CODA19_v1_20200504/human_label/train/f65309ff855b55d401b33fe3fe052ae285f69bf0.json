      "original_text": "A CHO cell clone (CHO-PoIFN-b) with stable porcine IFN-b expression under control of CMV promoter was selected under G418 pressure. In a 25 cm 2 cell culture flask (5 ml culture medium), the cumulative protein yield of recombinant PoIFN-b reached 2.3 Â 10 6 IU/ml. This cells clone maintained stable expression for at least 20 generations even in the absence of G418 selection pressure. The expressed recombinant PoIFN-b could induce the expression of porcine Mx protein in PK15 cells, and activate the chicken Mx promoter-controlled luciferase reporter gene expression, confirming that the recombinant PoIFN-b has the biological activity of natural porcine type-I interferon. In addition, the recombinant PoIFN-b fully protected PK15 cells against 1000 TCID 50 of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus and pseudo-rabies virus infection, demonstrating its high potential in therapeutic applications. This is the first report of establishing a mammalian cell line with stable expression of porcine IFN-b.",
