      "original_text": "M iniaturized integrated DNA analysis systems offer the potential to provide unprecedented advances in cost and speed relative to current benchtop-scale instrumentation by allowing rapid bioanalysis assaysto be performed in a portable self contained device format that can be inexpensively mass-produced. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been a natural focus of many of these miniaturization efforts, owing to its capability to efficiently replicate target regions ofinterest from small quantities template DNA. Scale-down ofPCR has proven to be particularly challenging, however, due to an unfavorable combination of relatively severe temperature extremes (resulting in the need to repeatedly heat minute aqueous sample volumes to temperatures in the vicinity of95\u0027C with minimal evaporation) and high surface area to volume conditions imposed by nanoliter reactor geometries (often leading to inhibition ofthe reaction by nonspecific adsorption ofreagents at the reactor walls). Despite these daunting challenges, considerable progress has been made in the development of microfluidic devices capable ofperforming increasingly sophisticated PCR-based bioassays.This chapter reviews the progress that has been made to date and assessesthe outlook for future advances.",
