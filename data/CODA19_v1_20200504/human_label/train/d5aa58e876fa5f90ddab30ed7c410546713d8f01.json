Then, 0.2 mM IPTG was added and the cells were incubated under shaking conditions for 18 h at 25 °C, after which the cells were harvested by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in T1 buffer (20 mM Tris/Cl(pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium azide, and 1 mM DTT) and sonicated. After centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded onto a DEAE ion-exchange column (GE healthcare) and the flow throw was collected. Next, the pooled sample was applied to amylose resin (NEB). The column was washed with T2 buffer (T1 buffer + 200 mM NaCl) and eluted with T3 buffer (T2 buffer + 10 mM maltose). The purity of the proteins was analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. The final yield of MBP-TRIM25 was determined by the Bradford assay with BSA as the standard and the samples were stored at �80 °C.",
