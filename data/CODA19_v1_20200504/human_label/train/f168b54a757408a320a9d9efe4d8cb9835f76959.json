      "original_text": "Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) encodes 15 nonstructural proteins (nsps) which play crucial roles in RNA transcription and genome replication. One of them, nsp3, contains an ADRP (adenosine diphosphate-ribose-1 0 -phosphatase) domain which was revealed in recent studies to have ADP-ribose-1 0 -monophosphatase (Appr-1 0 -pase) activity. Appr-1 0 -pase catalyzes the conversion of ADPribose-1 0 -monophosphate (Appr-1 0 -p) to ADP-ribose in the tRNA-splicing pathway. The gene segment encoding the IBV nsp3 ADRP domain has been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The protein has been crystallized and the crystals diffracted to 1.8 Å resolution. They belonged to space group P1, with unit-cell parameters a \u003d 41.1, b \u003d 43.2, c \u003d 48.9 Å , \u003d 78.0, \u003d 80.0, \u003d 73.6 . Each asymmetric unit contains two molecules.",
