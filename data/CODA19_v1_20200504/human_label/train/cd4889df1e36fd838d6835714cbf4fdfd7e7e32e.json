Incomplete KD patients had milder values in some laboratory indices. The preadmission and total fever durations were longer in group A than in group B. The proportion of incomplete KD was higher in group B, but incidence of coronary artery lesions (CALs) was lower. For laboratory indices, the C-reactive protein and follow-up platelet values were lower, and the hemoglobin and albumin values were higher in group B. The same clinical and laboratory findings were confirmed in the KD subgroups; those with the same fever duration of 5 or 6 days and same ages, those with complete KD, and those with incomplete KD in the two different time periods. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that clinical features of KD tend to be milder over time and manifest in a higher incidence of incomplete KD, lower incidence of CALs, and less severe laboratory findings in recent KD patients in Korea compared with their historic counterparts.",
