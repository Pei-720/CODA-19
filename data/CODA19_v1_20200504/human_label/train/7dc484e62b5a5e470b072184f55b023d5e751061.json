Carcinoembryonic antigen related cell adhesion molecule 1 (Ceacam1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein found on epithelium, T cells, and many tumors. It regulates a variety of physiologic and pathological processes such as tumor biology, leukocyte activation, and energy homeostasis. Previous studies suggest that Ceacam1 negatively regulates inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease models.",

In vivo, Ceacam1 2/2 T cells caused increased GVHD mortality and GVHD of the colon, and greater numbers of donor T cells were positive for activation markers (CD25 hi , CD62L lo ). Additionally, Ceacam1 2/2 CD8 T cells had greater expression of the gut-trafficking integrin a 4 b 7 , though both CD4 and CD8 T cells were found increased numbers in the gut posttransplant. Ceacam1 2/2 recipients also experienced increased GVHD mortality and GVHD of the colon, and alloreactive T cells displayed increased activation. Additionally, Ceacam1 2/2 mice had increased mortality and decreased numbers of regenerating small intestinal crypts upon radiation exposure. Conversely, Ceacam1-overexpressing T cells caused attenuated target-organ and systemic GVHD, which correlated with decreased donor T cell numbers in target tissues, and mortality. Finally, graft-versus-tumor survival in a Ceacam1 + lymphoma model was improved in animals receiving Ceacam1 2/2 vs. control T cells.",
