On the one hand, IMODä within the last few years has been proven to safely and effectively increase the life expectancy for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals by increasing CD4 lymphocytes. On the other hand, Arbidol, an antiviral agent has been used safely and effectively in the past two decades to prevent and cure all types of influenza and flu. Therefore, the combination of both in a single dosage to further increase CD4 lymphocytes and interferon gamma (IFN-c) could be a better choice for treatment of viral infections. This proposal tries to provide enough support and background for approval of a randomized clinical trial by a relevant team of investigators. ª 2014 Published",
