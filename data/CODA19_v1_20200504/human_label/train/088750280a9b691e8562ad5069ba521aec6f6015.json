However, the high turnover of village doctors, both individually and collectively, threaten the stability of village medical teams. This research evaluated the influence of job satisfaction, resilience, and work engagement on the village doctors\u0027 turnover intention, and explored the mediating role of work engagement and resilience between job satisfaction and the turnover intention of village doctors in China. Methods: A quantitative study using a self-administered questionnaire containing mostly structured items was conducted among village doctors with a sample size of 2693 from 1345 rural clinics in Shandong province, China, during May and June 2019. All variables including demographic characteristics, job satisfaction, resilience, work engagement and turnover intention were based on available literature, and measured on a 5-or 6-point Likert scale. Such statistical methods as one-way ANOVA, bivariate correlation, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) were used.",
