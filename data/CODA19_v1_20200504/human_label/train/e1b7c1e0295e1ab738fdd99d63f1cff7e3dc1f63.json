      "original_text": "Receptors for the Fc portion of immunoglobulins (FcRs) account for most cell-mediated biological activities of antibodies. The majority of FcRs are encoded by a set of genes, clustered in the fcr locus, on chromosome 1 in humans and on chromosome 1 and 3 in mice. Eight (in humans) and six (in mice) new genes were found, intermixed with FcR genes in corresponding fcr loci, which encode FcR-like molecules (FcRLs). FcRs and FcRLs are genetically, phylogenetically, structurally, and functionally related. FcRs and FcRLs, however, markedly differ by their ligands, their tissue distribution, and, therefore, by the biological functions they control. A systematic comparison of their biological properties leads to the conclusion that FcRLs are not like FcRs. They altogether form a single family within the immunoreceptor family, whose members fulfill distinct but complementary roles in immunity by differentially controlling innate and adaptive responses.",
