      "original_text": "In the Netherlands a major part of preparedness planning for an epidemic or pandemic consists of maintaining essential public services, e.g., by the police, fi re departments, army personnel, and healthcare workers. We provide estimates for peak demand for healthcare workers, factoring in healthcare worker absenteeism and using estimates from published epidemiologic models on the expected evolution of pandemic infl uenza in relation to the impact on peak surge capacity of healthcare facilities and intensive care units (ICUs). Using various published scenarios, we estimate their effect in increasing the availability of healthcare workers for duty during a pandemic. We show that even during the peak of the pandemic, all patients requiring hospital and ICU admission can be served, including those who have non-infl uenza-related conditions. For this rigorous task differentiation, clear hierarchical management, unambiguous communication, and discipline are essential and we recommend informing and training non-ICU healthcare workers for duties in the ICU. I n the Netherlands a major part of preparedness planning for an epidemic or pandemic, e.g., avian infl uenza A, consists of maintaining essential services provided by the police, fi re departments, army personnel, and healthcare workers (HCWs). Even if an effective vaccine against avian infl uenza (H5N1) would be available (1), preparation for a pandemic is still vital to maintain optimal care for acutecare patients and those with infl uenza-like illness (ILI). The preparation for excess workloads among HCWs becomes even more important with the emergence of highly pathogenic avian infl uenza strains.",
