      "original_text": "Effective isolation of nucleic acids from samples containing viral materials is an essential step for accurate diagnosis of viral infections. The necessity of this critical step before analytical identification and diagnosis of viral infections is paramount to screening programs and to identifying and monitoring epidemics and pandemics. With molecular assays rapidly evolving into routine practice, clinical laboratories face several challenges, including presence of small amounts of viral nucleic acids in abundant levels of genomic DNA and total RNA, processing of various sample types, and carry-over of polymerase chain reaction inhibitors, which could significantly affect polymerase chain reaction and microarray results. MagaZorb nucleic acid isolation technology overcomes these challenges and offers a simple and reliable method for isolation of highquality and high-yield nucleic acids. Although the MagaZorb technology is readily adaptable to automated platforms, it is also well suited to laboratories in remote areas of resource-poor countries, because a simple magnet is the only device required to perform the procedure manually. Performance characteristics and clinical application of the MagaZorb technology are briefly described here.",
