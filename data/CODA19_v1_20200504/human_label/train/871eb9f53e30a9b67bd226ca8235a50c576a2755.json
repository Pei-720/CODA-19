Furthermore, every few decades, respiratory virus pandemics emerge, putting the entire world population at risk. thus, there is an urgent need to quickly and precisely identify the infecting agent in a clinical setting. However, in many patients with influenza-like symptoms (ILS) the identity of the underlying pathogen remains unknown. In addition, it takes time and effort to individually identify the virus responsible for the ILS. Here, we present a new next-generation sequencing (NGS)based method that enables rapid and robust identification of pathogens in a pool of clinical samples without the need for specific primers. The method is aimed at rapidly uncovering a potentially common pathogen affecting many samples with an unidentified source of disease.",
