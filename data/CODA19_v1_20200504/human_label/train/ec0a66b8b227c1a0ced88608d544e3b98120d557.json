Higher prevalence of 5 (8.93%) was recorded in Holstein Friesian breed than Boran breed 1 (5.56%). However, breed showed no significant difference on E. coli infections (P \u003e 0.05). Higher prevalence of E. coli revealed below age of 30 days (17.39%) than calves aged between 30 and 90 days (8.33%) and above 90 days (0.00%). However, statistical association showed no difference (P \u003e 0.05). Parity showed a significant difference in prevalence of E. coli (P \u003c 0.05) in which infection increased with number of parity. Sex of the animal showed no association with infection of the calves (P \u003e 0.05). Diarrheic calves showed higher prevalence (33.3%) than non-diarrheic calves (4.62%) with strong statistical association (P \u003c 0.05). The present study showed a high prevalence of septicemic E. coli in the farm and intervention is strongly recommended.",
