      "original_text": "The two dimensional molecular tagging velocimetry (2D-MTV) has been used to measure velocity fields of the flow in a micro mixer. Instead of commonly used micro particles an optical tagging of the flow has been performed by using a caged dye. The pattern generation is done by imaging a mask for the first time. This allows to generate nearly any imaginable pattern. The flow induces a deformation of the optically written pattern that can be tracked by laser induced fluorescence. The series of raw images acquired in this way were analyzed quantitatively with a novel optical flow based technique. The reference measurements have been carried out allowing to draw conclusions about the accuracy of this procedure. A comparison to the standard technique of lPIV has also been conducted. Apart from measuring flow velocities in microfluidic mixing processes, the spatial distribution of concentration fields for different species has also been measured. To this end, a new technique has been developed that allows spatial measurements from Planar Spontaneous Raman Scattering (PSRS). The Raman stray light of the relevant species has been spectrally selected by a narrow bandpass filter and thus detected unaffectedly by the Raman stray light of other species. The successful operation of this measurement procedure in micro flows will be demonstrated exemplary for a mixing process of water and ethanol.",
