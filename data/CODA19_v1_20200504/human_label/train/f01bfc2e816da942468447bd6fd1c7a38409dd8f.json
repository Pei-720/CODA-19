      "original_text": "This study used the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to examine taxpayers\u0027 acceptance of the Internet tax-filing system. Based on data collected from 141 experienced taxpayers in Taiwan, the acceptance and the impact of quality antecedents on taxpayers\u0027 perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU) of the system were assessed and evaluated. The results indicated that the model of Internet tax-filing system was accepted with a reasonable goodness-of-fit. Three important findings include the following items. First, TAM proves to be a valid model to explain the taxpayers\u0027 acceptance of the Internet tax-filers\u0027 system. Meanwhile, PU has created more impact than PEOU on taxpayers\u0027 intention to use the system. Second, PU is positively influenced by such factors as information system quality (ISQ), information quality (IQ), as well as perceived credibility (PC). Third, IQ has a positive impact on PEOU. Based on the research findings, implications and limitations are then discussed for future possible research. D 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
