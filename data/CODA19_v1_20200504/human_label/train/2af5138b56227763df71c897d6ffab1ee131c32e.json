      "original_text": "The pathogenesis of GIII.2 bovine norovirus (BoNoV) is not well understood. Our study demonstrated persisting diarrhea and prolonged fecal shedding, but with a lack of significant intestinal lesions in gnotobiotic (Gn) calves infected with GIII.2 BoNoV, CV186-OH/00/US strain. Nine 4 to 7-day-old Angus/Jersey crossbred Gn calves were orally inoculated with 10.0-11.9 log 10 genomic equivalents (GE)/calf of CV186-OH (n\u003d7) or mock (n\u003d2). Calves were euthanized at post-inoculation day (PID) 1 (n\u003d1) when moderate to severe lethargy was observed and at PIDs 2-6 (n\u003d4) after lethargy had subsided. Two calves were kept longer term (until PID 30) for monitoring fecal shedding patterns by TaqMan real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Most infected calves exhibited two clinical signs: i) acute but persisting diarrhea and ii) acute moderate to severe lethargy. The two infected calves, followed longer-term, had prolonged fecal viral RNA shedding [peak average titer of 11.8 (± 0.2) log 10 GE/ml] at least until PID 20. By qRT-PCR, 5 infected calves had low viral RNA titers in serum, ranging from 4.0 to 5.8 log 10 GE/ml, at PIDs 1-5, but not (\u003c2.7 log 10 GE/ml) at PIDs 6-30. The latter observation coincided with the presence of serum IgG antibody to BoNoV at PIDs 8-30. Collectively, the GIII.2 BoNoV strain CV186-OH induced only mild enteropathogenicity, evident by the lack of significant intestinal lesions, but it led to persisting mild diarrhea and prolonged fecal virus shedding in Gn calves. The prolonged fecal shedding of GIII.2 BoNoV might partially explain how this virus is maintained as endemic infections in cattle.",
