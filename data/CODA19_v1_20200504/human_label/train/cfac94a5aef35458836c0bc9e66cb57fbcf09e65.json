      "original_text": "The cellular role of DNA is relatively limited, perhaps because of the restrictions imposed by bonding between complementary strands. Outside the cell, however, nanoengineers are uncovering the many hidden talents of DNA. The DNA sequence is able to process information in biochemical assays, its structure is an ideal building material, and its folding pathway allows DNA to move and respond to its environment. Here, I review several innovative applications of designed DNA molecules, some underlying design principles and the prospects for future developments. The applications of new DNA-based technologies range from molecular diagnostics to protein purification and from therapeutics to the assembly of tiny electronic circuits. These uses exploit the properties of DNA at three levels -sequence only, structure (which depends on sequence) and folding pathways (which depend on both sequence and structure) -as the following examples show.",
