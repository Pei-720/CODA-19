Diagnosis of \u0026\u0026sia caba\u0026 infections in horses by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELBA) and Western blot. inrernntionalJaurnulfnr Parasitology 24: 341-346. From Bubesia cabal/i in vitro cultures a preparation of 100% infected erythrocytes was obtained. From this, B. cabutli antigens were extracted with the detergent 3-[(3-CholamidopropyI)-dimethylammonio]-lpropane-sulfonate (CHAPS) and used as ELISA antigens. A control antigen of normal erythrocytes from the same donor horse was prepared in an identical manner. The ELBA and Western blot were validated by testing of sera from horses experimentally infected with B. caballi or B. equi or not infected with Babesia spp. ELISA and Western blot results were compared with those obtained by the immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) and complement fixation test (CFT). The sensitivity of the ELISA of98.3% obtained for sera from day 14 after infection was superior to the Western blot (94.9%), the IFAT (96.6%) and the CFT (28.8%). No positive results were obtained in the ELISA and Western blot with 106 sera from horses not infected with \u0026b\u0026a spp. resulting in a calculated specificity of 100% for both tests. Cross reactions of 8.",
