Methods: We used real-time TaqMan-based PCR to detect MWPyV in the feces (n \u003d 174) of children with diarrhea, nasopharyngeal aspirates (n \u003d 887) from children with respiratory infections, and sera (n \u003d 200) from healthy adults, and analyzed its clinical characteristics statistically. All the MWPyV-positive specimens were also screened for other common respiratory viruses.",

The samples were all co-infected with other respiratory viruses, most commonly with influenza viruses (69.2%) and human coronaviruses (30.7%). The MWPyV-positive children were diagnosed with bronchopneumonia or viral diarrhea. They ranged in age from 12 days to 9 years, and the most frequent symptoms were cough and fever. Conclusions: Real-time PCR is an effective tool for the detection of MWPyV in different types of samples. MWPyV infection mainly occurs in young children, and fecal-oral transmission is a possible route of its transmission.",
